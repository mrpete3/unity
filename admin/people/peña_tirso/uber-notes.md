# Uber notes

If you have trouble understanding spoken English, post a sign in the back seat of your car that says, "Please enter destination in app." That way, you avoid confusion about where you are supposed to take the client.

* 4.7 or higher rating for Uber to keep you as an active driver
* 4.6 or lower reating gets you dropped as a driver
* 4.75 rating is the Cleveland average

Learn how to cancel if in doubt to avoid bad rating.

If you are not a native English speaker, learn some handy phrases with which to interact with customers.

Easier clients during the day

Major causes for low ratings:

* Long route
* Bad communication

If you wait at the client's pick-up address for 5Â min and he does not show, you still get paid $5.
