# Holy Spirit

Jesus invites us to pray for the Holy Spirit [(Lk 11:13)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2011%3A13/).

David Luecke in his book _Your Encounters with the Holy Spirit_ encourages a believer to more actively seek what the Spirit can bring now.<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">§</a>]</sup>

What are the normal gifts of the Holy Spirit? [Gal 5:22‑23](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians%205%3A22-23/), [1Co 12:27‑31](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2012%3A27-31/), [1Co 13:1‑13](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2013/).


St Paul writes against boasting about spiritual experiences [(2Co 12:1‑5)](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Corinthians%2012%3A1-5/).


## Pietism

> The term Pietism connotes a movement in behalf of practical religion within the Lutheran Church of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Established at Halle by Philipp Jakob Spener, and following distinct and individual courses of development in Halle, Württemberg, and Herrnhut, it received a bond of union in its conviction that the type of Christianity then prevailing in Lutheranism stood in urgent need of reform, and that this could be brought about by "piety," or living faith made active and manifest in upright conduct.<sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">†</a>]</sup>

Pietism is a movement to seek a more genuine Christian life.

## Doubting another person's faith

When you live a genuine Christian life, you may question the faith of another, but beware of the situation of the Pharissee and tax collector[(Lk 18:10‑14)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+18:10/).
Christian faith grows by doing your duty as an unworthy servant [(Lk 17:5‑10)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2017%3A5-10/).
