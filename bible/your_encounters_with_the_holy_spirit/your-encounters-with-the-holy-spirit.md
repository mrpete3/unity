# Holy Spirit

Jesus invites us to pray for the Holy Spirit [(Lk 11:13)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2011%3A13/).

David Luecke in his book _Your Encounters with the Holy Spirit_ encourages a believer to more actively seek what the Spirit can bring now.<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">§</a>]</sup>

What are the normal gifts of the Holy Spirit? [Gal 5:22‑23](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians%205%3A22-23/), [1Co 12:27‑31](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2012%3A27-31/), [1Co 13:1‑13](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2013/).


St Paul writes against boasting about spiritual experiences [(2Co 12:1‑5)](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Corinthians%2012%3A1-5/).


## Pietism

> The term Pietism connotes a movement in behalf of practical religion within the Lutheran Church of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Established at Halle by Philipp Jakob Spener, and following distinct and individual courses of development in Halle, Württemberg, and Herrnhut, it received a bond of union in its conviction that the type of Christianity then prevailing in Lutheranism stood in urgent need of reform, and that this could be brought about by "piety," or living faith made active and manifest in upright conduct.<sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">†</a>]</sup>

Pietism is a movement to seek a more genuine Christian life.

## _Pia Desideria_ (_Pious Wishes_)

Written by Philip Jacob Spener in 1675, it was initially intended to be the preface for a republication of Johan Arndt's sermons, but turned out to be so popular, that it was published as its own book.
Spener discussed the contents of the book with his fellow pastors.<sup>[<a name="id0003" href="#ftn.id0003">※</a>]</sup>
This book represents a strong Lutheran tradition.

Things to look for:

* Rise of the laity.
* Christians meeting in private.
* Remnant of true Christians.

## Doubting another person's faith

When you live a genuine Christian life, you may question the faith of another, but beware of the situation of the Pharissee and tax collector[(Lk 18:10‑14)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+18:10/).
Christian faith grows by doing your duty as an unworthy servant [(Lk 17:5‑10)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2017%3A5-10/).

## The dangers of private meetings

My boss in Fort Wayne was a member of a large Baptist church that had many small group studies.
He described with alarm what happens when a small group leader starts teaching his own doctrine: there is no one to challenge him or to deal with the issue that he is teaching something different from the pastor.
Effectively, there is now a church within the church and the congregation is divided.

After Spener published _Pia Desideria_, private meetings led to division in congregations and even Donatism.<sup>[<a name="id0003" href="#ftn.id0003">‡</a>]</sup>
