# Holy Spirit

Jesus invites us to pray for the Holy Spirit [(Lk 11:13)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2011%3A13/).

David Luecke in his book _Your Encounters with the Holy Spirit_ encourages a believer to more actively seek what the Spirit can bring now.<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">§</a>]</sup>

What are the normal gifts of the Holy Spirit? [Gal 5:22‑23](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians%205%3A22-23/), [1Co 12:27‑31](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2012%3A27-31/), [1Co 13:1‑13](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2013/).


St Paul writes against boasting about spiritual experiences [(2Co 12:1‑5)](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Corinthians%2012%3A1-5/).

The Bible is clear that both doctrine and piety are important [(Ti 2)](http://www.esvbible.org/Titus%202/).

## Pietism

> The term Pietism connotes a movement in behalf of practical religion within the Lutheran Church of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Established at Halle by Philipp Jakob Spener, and following distinct and individual courses of development in Halle, Württemberg, and Herrnhut, it received a bond of union in its conviction that the type of Christianity then prevailing in Lutheranism stood in urgent need of reform, and that this could be brought about by "piety," or living faith made active and manifest in upright conduct.<sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">†</a>]</sup>

Pietism is a movement to seek a more genuine Christian life, a revival of moral and religious earnestness.

It arose in a time when Christian piety among the clergy was sometimes mocked.<sup>[<a name="id0005" href="#ftn.id0005">‰</a>]</sup>

At this time, civil authorities had a lot of control over the business of a congregation.<sup>[<a name="id0006" href="#ftn.id0006">‱</a>]</sup>

At this time, pastors were primarily trained in arguing doctrine but sometimes themselves fell into witchcraft and excessive eating and drinking.<sup>[<a name="id0007" href="#ftn.id0007">′</a>]</sup>

## _Pia Desideria_ (_Pious Wishes_)

Written by Philip Jacob Spener in 1675, it was initially intended to be the preface for a republication of Johan Arndt's sermons, but turned out to be so popular, that it was published as its own book.
Spener discussed the contents of the book with his fellow pastors.<sup>[<a name="id0003" href="#ftn.id0003">※</a>]</sup>
This book represents a strong Lutheran tradition.

Things to look for:

* Rise of the laity.
* Christians meeting in private.
* Remnant of true Christians.

Spener considered himself to be a bad boy when, at the age of twelve, he danced.<sup>[<a name="id0008" href="#ftn.id0008">″</a>]</sup>

Spener thought Sundays could be better used to build each other up in faith and holiness.
Private meetings for the cultivation of holiness were called _collegia pietatis_.<sup>[<a name="id0009" href="#ftn.id0009">‴</a>]</sup>

Spenter pointed out that at Christ's judgment, He will not commend us for being learned theologians but for how faithfully we sought to further the kingdom of God.<sup>[<a name="id0010" href="#ftn.id0010">‸</a>]</sup>

### Defects in Civil Authorities<sup>[<a name="id0011" href="#ftn.id0011">‹</a>]</sup>

Live in sin, debauchery, and self-interest.

### Defects in the Clergy<sup>[<a name="id0012" href="#ftn.id0012">›</a>]</sup>

Spener recognizes his own deficiency.
He also begins to criticize self-promotion and changing from congregation to congregation (45).
Since some pastors do not show the fruits of the Spirit [(Gal 5:22‑23)](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians%205%3A22-23/), he questions whether they are believers at all (46).

Spener falsely says that a pastor lacking true and godly faith is unable to perform the duties of their office and awaken faith in his hearers through the Word (47).
Balaam is a case in point where a wicked prophet effectively prophesied [(Nm 23‑24)](http://www.esvbible.org/Numbers%2023/).
Furthermore, God's Word has power in itself and never returns empty-handed [(Is 55:11)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah+55:11/).

Spener criticized the over-emphasis on doctrinal agreement (49‑50).
That raises an important point: When is it right to argue over doctrine?
Spener raises awareness that it is Satan's own desire that we “try to be smart and clever without the Scriptures or beyond them” (51).
He laments that scholastic theology has crept back into the Lutheran church after Luther had worked so hard to put biblical theology above it.
Then he offers the following passages to support biblical theology: [1Tm 1:4‑7](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Timothy%201%3A4-7/); [1Tm 6:3‑5](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Timothy%206%3A3-5/); [Col 2:8](http://www.esvbible.org/Colossians%202%3A8/).

### Defects in the Common People<sup>[<a name="id0013" href="#ftn.id0013">‼</a>]</sup>


## Doubting another person's faith

When you live a genuine Christian life, you may question the faith of another, but beware of the situation of the Pharisee and tax collector [(Lk 18:10‑14)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+18:10/).
Christian faith grows by doing your duty as an unworthy servant [(Lk 17:5‑10)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2017%3A5-10/).
[Gal 5:26](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians%205%3A26/); [1Co 12:21‑26](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2012%3A21-26/).

## The dangers of private meetings

My boss in Fort Wayne was a member of a large Baptist church that had many small group studies.
He described with alarm what happens when a small group leader starts teaching his own doctrine: there is no one to challenge him or to deal with the issue that he is teaching something different from the pastor.
Effectively, there is now a church within the church and the congregation is divided.

After Spener published _Pia Desideria_, private meetings led to division in congregations and even Donatism.<sup>[<a name="id0003" href="#ftn.id0003">‡</a>]</sup>
