## Old Testament [Dt 999:9‑99 ESV]

[1] “When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance and have taken possession of it and live in it, [2] you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from your land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket, and you shall go to the place that the LORD your God will choose, to make his name to dwell there.

## Epistle [Rm 999:9‑99 ESV; sermon text]

[8b] “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); [9] because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 999:9‑99 ESV]

[1] And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness [2] for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry.

## Introit [Ps 999:9‑99; antiphon: Ps 999:1]

> When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in | trouble;*  
> I will rescue him and | honor him.
