<blockquote>
<p><strong>Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.”</strong> <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/John%2013%3A1-7/">(John 13:1‑7 ESV)</a></p>

<p class="liturgy"><span class="dark-background-bold">L</span>  O Lord Jesus Christ, You took the form of a servant to serve us, Your fallen human creatures.
Give us grateful hearts, we pray, to thank You for serving us.
Give us humble hearts, we pray, to realize that we need You to serve us and wash our sins daily.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”

<p class="liturgy"><span class="dark-background-bold">L</span>  O Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us that we never become unclean before You.
Your Baptism declares us to be completely clean and gives us Your Holy Spirit.
Grant us contrition of our sins and faith in our Baptism that we return to it for the daily drowning of our flesh <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%206%3A4/">(Romans 6:4)</a>.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.

<div class="rubric">Feet are washed in an orderly manner, nobody washing his own feet.
One or several large plastic dish tubs serve well.
Mixing a small amount of antibacterial dish soap into the water helps keep things clean.
Each person's feet should be washed with their own clean towel.

<p class="liturgy"><span class="dark-background-bold">L</span>  Dear Lord Jesus, we confess that we are not greater than You.
You have washed our feet; now let us wash one another's feet.
By the grace of the Holy Spirit let us love one another as You have loved us <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/John%2013%3A34-35/">(John 13:34‑35)</a>.
