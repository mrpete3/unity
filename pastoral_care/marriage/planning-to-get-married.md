# Planning to get married?

At the beginning of the wedding ceremony, the pastor says these words:

> “Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and before His Church to witness the union of this man and this woman in holy matrimony. This is an honorable estate instituted and blessed by God in Paradise, before humanity's fall into sin.”

Here, _Paradise_ means _the Garden of Eden_. (Heaven is also called _Paradise_ [(Lk 23:43)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2023%3A43/).) Indeed, the Bible does teach that God made marriage between a man and a woman in the Garden of Eden, before Adam fell into sin. The key verse is this one: **Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh** (Genesis 2:24 ESV). This is marriage. We know this is marriage because Jesus quotes this very verse when He teaches about marriage:

> **And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?” He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”** (Matthew 19:3‑6 ESV)

Therefore, from Christ's own words we learn that in the beginning, God joined Adam and Eve together _in marriage_ in the Garden of Eden. Marriage is a holy estate instituted by God for man and woman to become one flesh; marriage was instituted by God _before_ Adam fell into sin [(Genesis 3](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%203/); that is why it is called _Holy Matrimony_.

Now Jesus says this about all marriages: **“What God has joined together, let no one put asunder”** (Matthew 19:6). The pastor speaks these very words in the wedding ceremony. _Marriage is God's business._

Our Lord's intentions for marriage are clear ([Matthew 5:27‑32](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%205%3A27-32/), [Matthew 19:3‑10](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2019%3A3-10/), [Mark 8:38](http://www.esvbible.org/Mark%208%3A38/), [Ephesians 5:21‑33](http://www.esvbible.org/Ephesians%205%3A21-33/)).  He gave the Sixth Commandment to protect marriage. (Read the Sixth Commandment in [Luther’s Small Catechism](http://oslcmankato.org/sites/default/files/smallcatechism_0.pdf).)
