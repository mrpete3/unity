#### New door closer installed on door leading from main Behrwald staircase to the cafeteria

Uncle Will and Pastor installed a new heavy‑duty door closer.
Pastor bought it from Lowe's with money from the youth group account.
We found [this YouTube video from Tell Manufacturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_XnXKedp5o) to be very helpful.

We performed a _regular arm installation_, not a _parallel arm installation_ or a _top jamb installation_.

#### New window pane and steel grill installed on door leading from main Behrwald staircase to the cafeteria

The old door closer, when it began to fail, caused the door to close too quickly on the hand of a youth at Saturday youth activities, who was pushing on the glass to open the door to go home.
He suffered a gash on his left elbow when a window pane broke on his left hand.
Trevon Preston, Ashley Kopitsky, Trina, and I took out all the broken glass on the night it happened (2016‑02‑27).

Laura Brenestuhl donated materials and tools to fix the window and install a steel grill on the push side of the door.
Will Heise donated the pane of glass.
The intention of the steel grill is to have people push on the grill, not glass, when they open the door.

Uncle Will and I installed the pane of glass and the steel grill.
