## Old Testament [Gn 18:17-33 ESV]

[17] The LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, [18] seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? [19] For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him.” [20] Then the LORD said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, [21] I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.”

[22] So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD. [23] Then Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? [24] Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? [25] Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?” [26] And the LORD said, “If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”

[27] Abraham answered and said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. [28] Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” [29] Again he spoke to him and said, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.” [30] Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.” [31] He said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.” [32] Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.” [33] And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

[17] ὁ δὲ Κύριος εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ κρύψω ἐγὼ ἀπὸ ῾Αβραὰμ τοῦ παιδός μου, ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ. 18 ῾Αβραὰμ δὲ γινόμενος ἔσται εἰς ἔθνος μέγα καὶ πολύ, καὶ ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς. 19 ᾔδειν γὰρ ὅτι συντάξει τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ φυλάξουσι τὰς ὁδοὺς Κυρίου ποιεῖν δικαιοσύνην καὶ κρίσιν, ὅπως ἂν ἐπαγάγῃ Κύριος ἐπὶ ῾Αβραὰμ πάντα, ὅσα ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτόν. 20 εἶπε δὲ Κύριος· κραυγὴ Σοδόμων καὶ Γομόρρας πεπλήθυνται πρός με, καὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῶν μεγάλαι σφόδρα. 21 καταβὰς οὖν ὄψομαι, εἰ κατὰ τὴν κραυγὴν αὐτῶν τὴν ἐρχομένην πρός με συντελοῦνται, εἰ δὲ μή, ἵνα γνῶ.

[22] καὶ ἀποστρέψαντες ἐκεῖθεν οἱ ἄνδρες ἦλθον εἰς Σόδομα. ῾Αβραὰμ δὲ ἔτι ἦν ἑστηκὼς ἐναντίον Κυρίου. [23] καὶ ἐγγίσας ῾Αβραὰμ εἶπε· μὴ συναπολέσῃς δίκαιον μετὰ ἀσεβοῦς καὶ ἔσται ὁ δίκαιος ὡς ὁ ἀσεβής; [24] ἐὰν ὦσι πεντήκοντα δίκαιοι ἐν τῇ πόλει, ἀπολεῖς αὐτούς; οὐκ ἀνήσεις πάντα τὸν τόπον ἕνεκεν τῶν πεντήκοντα δικαίων, ἐὰν ὦσιν ἐν αὐτῇ; [25] μηδαμῶς σὺ ποιήσεις ὡς τὸ ρῆμα τοῦτο, τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι δίκαιον μετὰ ἀσεβοῦς, καὶ ἔσται ὁ δίκαιος ὡς ὁ ἀσεβής. μηδαμῶς· ὁ κρίνων πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, οὐ ποιήσεις κρίσιν; [26] εἶπε δὲ Κύριος· ἐὰν ὦσιν ἐν Σοδόμοις πεντήκοντα δίκαιοι ἐν τῇ πόλει, ἀφήσω ὅλην τὴν πόλιν καὶ πάντα τὸν τόπον δι᾿ αὐτούς.

[27] καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ῾Αβραὰμ εἶπε· νῦν ἠρξάμην λαλῆσαι πρὸς τὸν Κύριόν μου, ἐγὼ δέ εἰμι γῆ καὶ σποδός· [28] ἐὰν δὲ ἐλαττονωθῶσιν οἱ πεντήκοντα δίκαιοι εἰς τεσσαρακονταπέντε, ἀπολεῖς ἕνεκεν τῶν πέντε πᾶσαν τὴν πόλιν; καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω, ἐὰν εὕρω ἐκεῖ τεσσσαρακονταπέντε. [29] καὶ προσέθηκεν ἔτι λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ τεσσαράκοντα; καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν τεσσαράκοντα. [30] καὶ εἶπε· μή τι κύριε, ἐὰν λαλήσω; ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ τριάκοντα; καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν τριάκοντα. [31] καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπειδὴ ἔχω λαλῆσαι πρὸς τὸν κύριον· ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ εἴκοσι; καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω, ἐὰν εὕρω ἐκεῖ εἴκοσι. [32] καὶ εἶπε· μήτι κύριε, ἐὰν λαλήσω ἔτι ἅπαξ· ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ δέκα; καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν δέκα. [33] ἀπῆλθε δὲ ὁ Κύριος, ὡς ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν τῷ ῾Αβραάμ, καὶ ῾Αβραὰμ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.

## Epistle [Col 2:6-19 ESV; sermon text]

[6] Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, [7] rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.

[8] See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. [9] For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, [10] and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. [11] In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, [12] having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. [13] And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, [14] by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. [15] He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.

[16] Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. [17] These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. [18] Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, [19] and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

[6] Ὡς οὖν παρελάβετε τὸν Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν τὸν κύριον, ἐν αὐτῷ περιπατεῖτε, [7] ἐρριζωμένοι καὶ ἐποικοδομούμενοι ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ βεβαιούμενοι τῇ πίστει καθὼς ἐδιδάχθητε, περισσεύοντες ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ.

[8] βλέπετε μή τις ὑμᾶς ἔσται ὁ συλαγωγῶν διὰ τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης κατὰ τὴν παράδοσιν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, κατὰ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου καὶ οὐ κατὰ Χριστόν: [9] ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικεῖ πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς θεότητος σωματικῶς, [10] καὶ ἐστὲ ἐν αὐτῷ πεπληρωμένοι, ὅς ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλὴ πάσης ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας, [11] ἐν ᾧ καὶ περιετμήθητε περιτομῇ ἀχειροποιήτῳ ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός, ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, [12] συνταφέντες αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ βαπτισμῷ, ἐν ᾧ καὶ συνηγέρθητε διὰ τῆς πίστεως τῆς ἐνεργείας τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν: [13] καὶ ὑμᾶς νεκροὺς ὄντας [ἐν] τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν, συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς σὺν αὐτῷ, χαρισάμενος ἡμῖν πάντα τὰ παραπτώματα, [14] ἐξαλείψας τὸ καθ' ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον τοῖς δόγμασιν ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν, καὶ αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ:
[15] ἀπεκδυσάμενος τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας ἐδειγμάτισεν ἐν παρρησίᾳ, θριαμβεύσας αὐτοὺς ἐν αὐτῷ.

[16] Μὴ οὖν τις ὑμᾶς κρινέτω ἐν βρώσει καὶ ἐν πόσει ἢ ἐν μέρει ἑορτῆς ἢ νεομηνίας ἢ σαββάτων, [17] ἅ ἐστιν σκιὰ τῶν μελλόντων, τὸ δὲ σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ. [18] μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς καταβραβευέτω θέλων ἐν ταπεινοφροσύνῃ καὶ θρησκείᾳ τῶν ἀγγέλων, ἃ ἑόρακεν ἐμβατεύων, εἰκῇ φυσιούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ, [19] καὶ οὐ κρατῶν τὴν κεφαλήν, ἐξ οὗ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων ἐπιχορηγούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ θεοῦ.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 11:1-13 ESV]

[1] Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.” [2] And he said to them, “When you pray, say:

> “Father, hallowed be your name.  
> Your kingdom come.  
> [3] Give us each day our daily bread,  
> [4] and forgive us our sins,  
> for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.  
> And lead us not into temptation.”
	
[5] And he said to them, “Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, [6] for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’; [7] and he will answer from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything’? [8] I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs. [9] And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [10] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [11] What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; [12] or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? [13] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”

[1] Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἐν τόπῳ τινὶ προσευχόμενον, ὡς ἐπαύσατο, εἶπέν τις τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν, Κύριε, δίδαξον ἡμᾶς προσεύχεσθαι, καθὼς καὶ Ἰωάννης ἐδίδαξεν τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ. [2] εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς, Οταν προσεύχησθε, λέγετε,

> Πάτερ, ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου:  
> ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου:  
> [3] τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον δίδου ἡμῖν τὸ καθ' ἡμέραν:  
> [4] καὶ ἄφες ἡμῖν τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν,  
> καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ ἀφίομεν παντὶ ὀφείλοντι ἡμῖν:  
> καὶ μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν.

[5] Καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς, Τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἕξει φίλον καὶ πορεύσεται πρὸς αὐτὸν μεσονυκτίου καὶ εἴπῃ αὐτῷ, Φίλε, χρῆσόν μοι τρεῖς ἄρτους, [6] ἐπειδὴ φίλος μου παρεγένετο ἐξ ὁδοῦ πρός με καὶ οὐκ ἔχω ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ: [7] κἀκεῖνος ἔσωθεν ἀποκριθεὶς εἴπῃ, Μή μοι κόπους πάρεχε: ἤδη ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται, καὶ τὰ παιδία μου μετ' ἐμοῦ εἰς τὴν κοίτην εἰσίν: οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστὰς δοῦναί σοι. [8] λέγω ὑμῖν, εἰ καὶ οὐ δώσει αὐτῷ ἀναστὰς διὰ τὸ εἶναι φίλον αὐτοῦ, διά γε τὴν ἀναίδειαν αὐτοῦ ἐγερθεὶς δώσει αὐτῷ ὅσων χρῄζει. [9] κἀγὼ ὑμῖν λέγω, αἰτεῖτε, καὶ δοθήσεται ὑμῖν: ζητεῖτε, καὶ εὑρήσετε: κρούετε, καὶ ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν. [10] πᾶς γὰρ ὁ αἰτῶν λαμβάνει, καὶ ὁ ζητῶν εὑρίσκει, καὶ τῷ κρούοντι ἀνοιγ[ής]εται. [11] τίνα δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν τὸν πατέρα αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς ἰχθύν, καὶ ἀντὶ ἰχθύος ὄφιν αὐτῷ ἐπιδώσει; [12] ἢ καὶ αἰτήσει ᾠόν, ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ σκορπίον; [13] εἰ οὖν ὑμεῖς πονηροὶ ὑπάρχοντες οἴδατε δόματα ἀγαθὰ διδόναι τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν, πόσῳ μᾶλλον ὁ πατὴρ [ὁ] ἐξ οὐρανοῦ δώσει πνεῦμα ἅγιον τοῖς αἰτοῦσιν αὐτόν.

## Introit [Ps 119:145-149; antiphon: Ps 50:15]

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, in the Old Testament reading you heard old Abraham haggling with God over Sodom and Gomorrah.
A great outcry had come before God&mdash;no doubt prayers of &ldquo;Lord, the men of Sodom have given up natural relations with women and are consumed with passion for one another [(Rm&nbsp;1:27)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%201%3A27/)! Please stop this!&rdquo;&mdash; and the Lord did stop it.
God tells Abraham that the sin of Sodom is very grave [(Gn&nbsp;18:20)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2018%3A20/)
and He is headed down to Sodom and Gomorrah to see if the outcry against the city is really true, as if He did not already know, as if He did not already know what was going to happen.
Now there were three men talking with Abraham, and it appears that when one of the men spoke, the Bible says, **&ldquo;The LORD said.&rdquo;**
It is later written that **_the two angels_** went to Sodom in the evening, where they met Lot at the gate of Sodom [(Gn&nbsp;19:1)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2019%3A1/).
So it appears that God Himself and two angels were speaking to Abraham on a hot day.

Abraham dared to speak to God and said, &ldquo;Lord, do you really want to do this&mdash;destroy a whole city? **Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing!**&rdquo;

**&ldquo;If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.&rdquo;**

Abraham haggled with God and brought the number down to ten, but God still destroyed the city for its rampant sexual sin.

Beloved in the Lord, it does not take a Biblical scholar to figure out that we, the United States of America, are parading our sin like Sodom.
Point the finger at the homosexuals and you find that there are three fingers pointing back at you.
_Long before homosexual marriage was legalized in our land_,
heterosexual men despised marriage by pornography, sex outside of marriage, adultery, and divorce; then the women followed suit.
This did not start ten or twenty years ago&mdash;it started _generations_ go&mdash;our departure from marriage has been going on for generations and appears, frankly, to have spun out of control.
In our unrepentance, God has turned us over to the passions of our flesh, and you know how that will turn out.
Where are Sodom and Gomorrah today? Lord, have mercy!
Woe to us! We have brought evil on ourselves [(Is&nbsp;3:9)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah+3:9/). Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!

Yet going back to our Old Testament reading in Genesis, chapter&nbsp;18, turn back one chapter to Genesis, chapter&nbsp;17.
There, God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision,
which may not seem like such a great thing, but it really is because God attaches a promise to Old Testament circumcision:

> **&ldquo;And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.&rdquo;** [(Gn&nbsp;17:8 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2017%3A8/)

In other words, &ldquo;Your circumcision is the outer sign the you are mine&mdash;I am your God.&rdquo;



AMEN.
