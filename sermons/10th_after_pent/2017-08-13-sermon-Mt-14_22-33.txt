## Old Testament [Jb 38:4‑18 ESV]

> [4] “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?\
> Tell me, if you have understanding.\
> [5] Who determined its measurements—surely you know!\
> Or who stretched the line upon it?\
> [6] On what were its bases sunk,\
> or who laid its cornerstone,\
> [7] when the morning stars sang together\
> and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

> [8] “Or who shut in the sea with doors\
> when it burst out from the womb,\
> [9] when I made clouds its garment\
> and thick darkness its swaddling band,\
> [10] and prescribed limits for it\
> and set bars and doors,\
> [11] and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther,\
> and here shall your proud waves be stayed’?

> [12] “Have you commanded the morning since your days began,\
> and caused the dawn to know its place,\
> [13] that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth,\
> and the wicked be shaken out of it?\
> [14] It is changed like clay under the seal,\
> and its features stand out like a garment.\
> [15] From the wicked their light is withheld,\
> and their uplifted arm is broken.

> [16] “Have you entered into the springs of the sea,\
> or walked in the recesses of the deep?\
> [17] Have the gates of death been revealed to you,\
> or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?\
> [18] Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth?\
> Declare, if you know all this.

## Epistle [Rm 10:5‑17 ESV]

[5] For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. [6] But the righteousness based on faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) [7] “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). [8] But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); [9] because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. [10] For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. [11] For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” [12] For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. [13] For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

[14] How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? [15] And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!” [16] But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?” [17] So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 14:22‑33 ESV; sermon text]

[22] Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. [23] And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, [24] but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. [25] And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. [26] But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear. [27] But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.”

[28] And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” [29] He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. [30] But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, “Lord, save me.” [31] Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?” [32] And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. [33] And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”

[22] Καὶ εὐθέως ἠνάγκασεν τοὺς μαθητὰς ἐμβῆναι εἰς τὸ πλοῖον καὶ προάγειν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ πέραν, ἕως οὗ ἀπολύσῃ τοὺς ὄχλους. 
[23] καὶ ἀπολύσας τοὺς ὄχλους ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος κατ' ἰδίαν προσεύξασθαι. ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης μόνος ἦν ἐκεῖ. 
[24] τὸ δὲ πλοῖον ἤδη σταδίους πολλοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἀπεῖχεν, βασανιζόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν κυμάτων, ἦν γὰρ ἐναντίος ὁ ἄνεμος. 
[25] τετάρτῃ δὲ φυλακῇ τῆς νυκτὸς ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς περιπατῶν ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν. 
[26] οἱ δὲ μαθηταὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης περιπατοῦντα ἐταράχθησαν λέγοντες ὅτι Φάντασμά ἐστιν, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου ἔκραξαν. 
[27] εὐθὺς δὲ ἐλάλησεν [ὁ Ἰησοῦς] αὐτοῖς λέγων, Θαρσεῖτε, ἐγώ εἰμι: μὴ φοβεῖσθε. 

[28] ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν, Κύριε, εἰ σὺ εἶ, κέλευσόν με ἐλθεῖν πρὸς σὲ ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα: 
[29] ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, Ἐλθέ. καὶ καταβὰς ἀπὸ τοῦ πλοίου [ὁ] Πέτρος περιεπάτησεν ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν. 
[30] βλέπων δὲ τὸν ἄνεμον [ἰσχυρὸν] ἐφοβήθη, καὶ ἀρξάμενος καταποντίζεσθαι ἔκραξεν λέγων, Κύριε, σῶσόν με. 
[31] εὐθέως δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα ἐπελάβετο αὐτοῦ καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Ὀλιγόπιστε, εἰς τί ἐδίστασας; 
[32] καὶ ἀναβάντων αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον ἐκόπασεν ὁ ἄνεμος. 
[33] οἱ δὲ ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες, Ἀληθῶς θεοῦ υἱὸς εἶ.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, let us return to the Holy Gospel, where last week Jesus fed the 5,000.
The disciples told Him, **"Send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves."**
But Jesus said **"They need not go away; _you_ give them something to eat"** [(Mt 14:15‑16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+14/).
And they did!
So, it is worth noting that Jesus did not feed the 5,000: on Christ's Word His *disciples* fed the 5,000.
Jesus blessed the five loaves and the two fish, the disciples gave the bread and fish to the crowds, and they all ate and were satisified. Amazing! God be praised!

Consider this as a follower of Christ yourself: "Take up your cross and follow Me."
You are faced with the impossible task of feeding all these people who have come to Jesus; the situation got out of hand.
In your mind, *you* think to send the people away.
Is that a sin, to send people away so they can walk to the store and buy something to eat?
No, it is a practical solution for the problem of feeding thousands of people.
*[Humor]* All they have to do is go to the Wal‑Mart Super Center out there in the desolate place which has enough food on the shelves to feed 12,000 people.
There are no Super Centers in the wilderness, and who says all the people have money?
In reality, I imagine the 5,000 would have dispersed into several towns and villages looking for food to eat, and I imagine that when the last ones finally got something to eat, they would have traveled for a long time, and some could have fainted along the way, including women and children.
The situation got out of hand---thousands are following Jesus---and *you* think it is best to somehow get rid of the people.
Fine.
But _Jesus_ says, **"_You_ give them something to eat."**

When you think one way and Jesus says another, what will you do?
Plain and simple: When you think one way and Jesus says another, *what will you do? Who will you trust?*
Let me give you a simple example: When someone sins against you, what does Jesus say?
Does anybody know? ...
You know the answer from Sunday School: Forgive him!
To take up your cross and follow Jesus is an automatic *so we to will sincerely forgive and gladly do good to those who sin against us*.
If there is any doubt about what Jesus says, just come back to Sunday School for a day or confirmation class and relearn what you have been taught since your youth.
I do not know about you, but I can think of *all kinds* of things to do other than forgive someone who sins against me.
Yet Christ's Word stands: "_You_ forgive _him_."
By Christ's Word I am to take the initiative---rejoicing in Christ having first forgiven me---rejoicing in **while we were still sinners, Christ died for us** [(Rm 5:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+5/)---and sincerely forgive and gladly do good to the person who sinned against me.
It is simple; it is clear.
This is what Christ says.

I have drawn a parallel between the feeding of the 5,000 and forgiving someone who has trespassed against you.
You think one way and Christ says another.
Beloved in the Lord, stick with what Christ says!
In the case of the feeding of the 5,000, the disciples found themselves being the hands that fed the 5,000.
If they had followed their own idea, the crowds would have gone and some of the people would have fainted looking for food.
And they would have stayed with Jesus and enjoyed some peace and quiet.
But by *obeying what Christ said*, they had the experience of being the hands that fed the 5,000 and everyone ate and was satisfied!
That is what is at stake when you think one way and Christ says another: you face either a disaster or a blessing.
Thanks be to God that the disciples listened to Jesus, and the feeding of the 5,000 turned out to be a blessing that is so famous that it is recorded in all four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

Now, immediately after that, Jesus makes the disciples get in a boat and sail across the Sea of Galilee.
Under good conditions, it might take only two hours to do it,[^1] but this night is different.
The boat was **beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them**, and it was the **fourth watch of the night**, which is between 3 A.M. and 6 A.M.
They have been sailing all night and they still have not gotten to the other side.
Let us, in our imaginations, go out now on a boat trip on Lake Erie, which, no doubt, many of you have done at one time or another---take a boat trip on Lake Erie.
And, of course, there are days when the sky might be overcast but the wind is calm and you say, "What a beautiful day on the lake!"
But what may at first have seemed calm and tranquil changes quickly when the wind kicks up, and there you are, out in a boat in the middle of Lake Erie with the wind and the waves against you.
You are in danger---you are in another impossible situation---but *don't forget that you just fed the 5,000*.

Jesus comes walking out on the water. **"Take heart; _it is I_. Do not be afraid."**
When Jesus says, **"It is I,"** he is saying it so is sounds like He is saying *Yahweh*.

AMEN.
