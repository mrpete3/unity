## Old Testament [Gn 9:8‑17 ESV]

[8] Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, [9] “Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you, [10] and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth. [11] I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” [12] And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: [13] I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. [14] When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, [15] I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. [16] When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” [17] God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”

## Epistle [Eph 3:14‑21 ESV; sermon text]

[14] For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, [15] from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, [16] that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
[17] so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, [18] may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, [19] and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

[20] Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, [21] to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 6:45‑56 ESV]

[45] Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. [46] And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. [47] And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. [48] And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, [49] but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, [50] for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.” [51] And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, [52] for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.

[53] When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. [54] And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him [55] and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. [56] And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
We continue in our Epistle readings from St. Paul's letter to the Ephesians.
The congregation in Ephesus has Jews and Gentiles side-by-side in the pews and kneeling together at the altar to receive Holy Communion---Jews and Gentiles who normally would be together.
"Let the Jew's have their church and we Gentiles have our church"
was *not* the case in Ephesus.
On a sad note, our own congregation was founded a hundred years ago because German-speaking Missouri Synod congregations wanted nothing to do with English services in their churches.
There may be a parallel between this situation and the Jew-Gentile situation in Ephesus.
The German folk at St. Mark, maybe the pastor included, did not want English services at St. Mark, so we started a separate congregation in the same neighborhood just to have English services.
We called Pastor Long to serve us, but, by the way, he was looked down upon by the German pastors.
I have a huge question in my mind: Did this separation of English and German services into separate congregations have anything to do with the Bible?
It should have.
I have heard that it was argued at that time that German-speaking pastors argued that Biblical theology cannot be taught as clearly in English as it can in German.
So much biblical arguments.
Let us look for a real biblical argument in the Christian congregation in Ephesus.
The Jews and Gentiles together at one altar in Ephesus should have been, and maybe was, a strong biblical argument to abandon the reasoning of keeping German and English in separate buildings.
But, time took care of that problem; all those once German-speaking congregations now have English services. The real problem a hundred years ago seems to have been *lack of love*.

Which brings us back to, if you recall the end of last week's sermon, the somber letter of Christ to the church in Ephesus as recorded in the book of Revelation:

> **"But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent."** ([Rv 2:4‑5](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+2:4/) ESV)

Clearly the Bible teaches that love demontrates itself in good works done to our neighbor, and that *if these works dry up*---if we stop loving each other and our neighbor---*we have lost our faith*.
Yes, beloved in the Lord, it *is* possible to drive the Holy Spirit out of our hearts and lose our faith.
If, God forbid, love dries up in our hearts, our good works will cease, and that will be the sign that we lost our faith, and we will be condemned at the final judgment. Lord, we believe, help our unbelief ([Mk 9:24](https://www.esv.org/Mark+9:24/))!

It is now, then, time to consider *what we believe and why we love*, not as reasoning but as who God is: God is love ([1Jn 4:8b](https://www.esv.org/1+John+4:8/)).
Jesus is God ([Ti 2:13](https://www.esv.org/Titus+2:13/)).
If we believe in Jesus, our love cannot fail ([1Co 13:8](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1-Corinthians-Chapter-13/)).
It is also in our Epistle lesson time for the Ephesian Christians to consider the love of Jesus.

> **... that Christ may dwell in your hearts _through faith_** (Faith is first.) **---that you, being rooted and grounded _in love_, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know _the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge_, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.**

... that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit.

**_The love of Christ that surpasses knowledge_**---beloved in the Lord, the Bible is not so much a demonstration of God's reasoning as it is of His love.
Make no mistake, there is much to learn about God's reasoning in the Bible.
Take Moses arguing with the LORD for example:

> **Then the LORD said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.”**

> **So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD. Then Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?” And the LORD said, “If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”** ([Gn 18:20‑26](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+18:22/) ESV)

Do you remember how it ends?
Abraham is reasoning with God.
"Lord, You won't destroy Sodom and Gomorrah if you find 50 righteous people there, will You?"

"No, I won't."

"Lord, You won't destroy Sodom and Gomorrah if you find 45 righteous people there, will You?"

"No, I won't."

And Abraham talks God down to---do you remember?---he talks God down to *ten*.
The sin of Sodom---sexual sin---was so great and there were not even ten righteous people in the whole city, that God destroyed them with sulfur and fire from heaven, sparing only Lot and his daughters; Lot's wife turned to salt ([Gn 19:26](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+19:26/)).

These are no longer normal times, where Christ's love has been revealed.
Take Joseph and his brothers, for example.

...

>  **But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of God? As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.** ([Gn 50:19‑21](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+50:19/) ESV)

Joseph is in the Bible to teach us about the love of Christ.
The Holy Spirit is in our hearts to certify that this love of Christ is true.

Then we have our experiences where we get us use this love of Christ in our affairs---to test its powers. This, frankly, is beyond knowledge, beyond understanding, but by the grace of the Holy Spirit, we have it: the love of Christ in our hearts.
Now may this love motivate and regulate all our affairs amongst ourselves and with our neighbor.
**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
