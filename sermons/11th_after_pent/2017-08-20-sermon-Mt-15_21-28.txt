## Old Testament [Is 56:1, 6‑8 ESV]

> [1] Thus says the LORD:\
> “Keep justice, and do righteousness,\
> for soon my salvation will come,\
> and my righteousness be revealed.

> [6] “And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD,\
> to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD,\
> and to be his servants,\
> everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,\
> and holds fast my covenant—\
> [7] these I will bring to my holy mountain,\
> and make them joyful in my house of prayer;\
> their burnt offerings and their sacrifices\
> will be accepted on my altar;\
> for my house shall be called a house of prayer\
> for all peoples.”\
> [8] The Lord GOD,\
> who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares,\
> “I will gather yet others to him\
> besides those already gathered.”

## Epistle [Rm 11:1‑2a, 13‑15, 28‑32 ESV]

[1] I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. [2a] God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.

[13] Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry [14] in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. [15] For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?

[28] As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. [29] For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. [30] For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, [31] so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. [32] For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 15:21‑28 ESV; sermon text]

[21] And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. [22] And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.” [23] But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying out after us.” [24] He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” [25] But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.” [26] And he answered, “It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” [27] She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.” [28] Then Jesus answered her, “O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed instantly.

[21] Καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐκεῖθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὰ μέρη Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος. 
[22] καὶ ἰδοὺ γυνὴ Χαναναία ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων ἐκείνων ἐξελθοῦσα ἔκραζεν λέγουσα, Ἐλέησόν με, κύριε, υἱὸς Δαυίδ: ἡ θυγάτηρ μου κακῶς δαιμονίζεται. 
[23] ὁ δὲ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῇ λόγον. καὶ προσελθόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ἠρώτουν αὐτὸν λέγοντες, Ἀπόλυσον αὐτήν, ὅτι κράζει ὄπισθεν ἡμῶν. 
[24] ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν, Οὐκ ἀπεστάλην εἰ μὴ εἰς τὰ πρόβατα τὰ ἀπολωλότα οἴκου Ἰσραήλ. 
[25] ἡ δὲ ἐλθοῦσα προσεκύνει αὐτῷ λέγουσα, Κύριε, βοήθει μοι. 
[26] ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν, Οὐκ ἔστιν καλὸν λαβεῖν τὸν ἄρτον τῶν τέκνων καὶ βαλεῖν τοῖς κυναρίοις. 
[27] ἡ δὲ εἶπεν, Ναί, κύριε, καὶ γὰρ τὰ κυνάρια ἐσθίει ἀπὸ τῶν ψιχίων τῶν πιπτόντων ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης τῶν κυρίων αὐτῶν. 
[28] τότε ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῇ, *)=ω γύναι, μεγάλη σου ἡ πίστις: γενηθήτω σοι ὡς θέλεις. καὶ ἰάθη ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ τῆς ὥρας ἐκείνης.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, in our Holy Gospel today, Jesus withdraws to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
Do these names---*Tyre* and *Sidon*---ring a Bible bell for you?
Allow me to remind you from the Old Testament:

> **Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him. And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the _Sidonians_, and went and served Baal and worshiped him.** [(1Ki 16:30‑31 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+16/)

Do you remember Ahab and Jezebel?
Do you remember Baal and Ashtoreth?
Baal goes with Ashtoreth (or Asherah), and together they are a demonic couple of false gods.
Jezebel worshiped them yet King Ahab of Israel married her---what a mistake!
His leadership plummeted the kingdom in Israel into idolatry.
Whatever they did at a Baal and Ashtoreth worship service---abandoning the hearing of God's Word, abandoning the feasts at the temple in Jerusalem---whatever they did when they worshiped Baal and Ashtoreth is too revolting to mention[^1]---demons can get you to do terrible things---but it overtook the northern kingdom once Ahab married Jezebel like worshiping the golden calf overtook the Israelites in the wilderness.

[^1]: [http://www.icr.org/books/defenders/1288/](http://www.icr.org/books/defenders/1288/), accessed 20 August 2017.

You cannot help but remember how strictly the LORD warned the Israelites not to dabble in idolatry *not even a drop* and *not to marry foreigners*---not because of their nationality *per se* but because *they worshiped false gods*.

> **"When the LORD your God brings you into [the Promised Land], and clears away many nations before you, ... and when the LORD your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them. _You shall not intermarry with them_, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons, _for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods_. Then the anger of the LORD would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly."**
[(Dt 7:1‑4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+7/)

Make no mistake, when you worship a false god---when you break the first and foremost Commandment: **You shall have not other gods before Me. _What does this mean?_ We should fear, love, and trust in God above all things**---when you worship an idol, God marks you for destruction.
When God describes his anger at idolatry in the Bible, He does not say, "That's too bad---they meant no harm."
He uses a husband's anger over adultery as a word picture---the Bible portrays an idolatrous people to be an adulterous wife and the LORD her jealous husband (Jer 3:6‑20; Ezk 16:8‑52).
Idolatry is no joke.
Yes, these word pictures of adultery in the Bible even use offensive language (Jer 3:6; Ezk 16:15, 36).
But read the prophet Hosea and you will find out how God took it one step further.
He called the prophet Hosea to literally marry a woman who then committed adultery and *then* the LORD told Hosea to win her back!
And Hosea did it---he won back her adulterous wife Gomer.
Beloved in the Lord, that is who Jesus is to idolaters: a faithful husband winning back his faithless wife.

The LORD did eventually destroy all of King Ahab's family for their idolatry---Jezebel was thrown off a wall and eaten by dogs [(2Ki 9:30‑37)](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+9/)---for they were idolaters who despised the one true God and were destroyed.
The people Ahab once ruled, by the way, became the Samaritans.

So, as we learn in the Bible, you cannot hear the name *Sidon* without recalling its aggressive idolatry of Baal and Ashtoreth---Sidon is a hotbed of idolatry.
Their idolatry may have even spread to the Philistines: archaeological findings suggest that the Philistines gave up their false god Dagon to worship Baal.[^2]
You cannot help but remember that Jezebel was the daughter of the king of Sidon, and here we have Jesus, 900 years later, withdrawing to, of all places, the region of Tyre and Sidon---the place where Jezebel came from.

[^2]: *LSB Study Bible* footnote on 2Ki 1:2.

As hard as Jesus is on idolatry, however, He does speak of Tyre and Sidon with some comfort---as if there is hope.
Our Lord says in Luke, chapter 10,

> **"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in _Tyre and Sidon, they_ would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you."** [(Lk 10:13‑14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+10/)

He is not blessing Tyre and Sidon, but speaks of the people there as being capable of repenting of their idolatry---and what a blessing it is to be able at all to repent---while the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida are not able to repent.
It sound to me like Tyre and Sidon are not the bottom of the barrel anymore.
And our Lord most definitely *blesses* the region of Tyre and Sidon by going there in our Holy Gospel.

> **And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.”**

Of all the places in the world where you would not be surprised to see a demon-possessed girl, it would be the region of Tyre and Sidon---Baal has had his way with these people for generations.
When you invite Satan in, he will come and bring his demons with him.
I believe there were *many* demon-possesed children in the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Jesus did not answer her a word.
His silence is pregnant with meaning, but I am not sure what it is.
The disciples beg Him to send her away---this Syrophoenician woman is not someone they wanted to deal with.
It is probable that this woman is an idolater like so many others in the region.
Satan has taken control of them and their children though their own fault---through their own idolatry.
We do well to remember from our catechism Exodus, chapter 20:

> **I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me.** (Ex 20:5, NIV84)

When you push out the Holy Spirit, He leaves and lets the demons come in on you *and* your children *and* your children's children *and* your children's children's children.
Lord have mercy!
And Jesus reveals to us in the Holy Gospel that He *does* have mercy.
He finally speaks to the woman,

> **"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."**

> **But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.”**

Even idolaters love their children.

Jesus answers,

> **"It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."**

That is right: this is an insult from the lips of Jesus.
He calls the woman a dog.
This is *not* a moment where Jesus slips up and says something He should not say.
My suggestion is that this woman was brought up in idolatry and by being an idolater, her status before God was *worthless*.
We know that Jesus could read her heart though, and she indicates what is on her heart when she says,

> **"Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."**

Jesus calls her a dog, but she calls Him her Master.
By the grace of the Holy Spirit, I believe that the Syrophoenician woman has abandoned Baal and any other false god she might have worshiped.
She has abandoned her idols and come begging to Jesus, her God and Savior (Ti 2:13).
She has come to faith in Jesus not knowing that Jesus was to die a bloody death to atone for her sins, but believing that *He is stronger than Satan*. Alleluia!
And, beloved in the Lord, believing in Jesus changes everything.
She would no doubt one day wonder at His death and Resurrection and come to understand that her Baptism buries her into His death and raises her again by His Resurrection (Rm 6:4),
but for now she has simply abandoned her idol and come to Jesus, trusting He can help her in her need.
Her status as idolater is forgotten and Jesus addresses her as a child of heaven,

> **"O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire."**

**And her daughter was healed instantly.**
Beloved in the Lord, it is written in 1 John, chapter 3,

> **Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.** [(1Jn 3:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+3/)

Believe in Jesus, and the works of the devil are destroyed.
You do not destroy the devil---Jesus destroys the devil---you need only to put your confidence in Him.
It may be generations of the works of the devil that have been poured out in your life,
but Jesus puts and end to it all when you trust that He can do it.
By faith in Him, we are rescued from the devils dominion and have entered His holy kingdom, to serve Him in righteousness, innocence, and blessedness.
AMEN.
