## Old Testament [Is 56:1, 6‑8 ESV]

> [1] Thus says the LORD:\
> “Keep justice, and do righteousness,\
> for soon my salvation will come,\
> and my righteousness be revealed.

> [6] “And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD,\
> to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD,\
> and to be his servants,\
> everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,\
> and holds fast my covenant—\
> [7] these I will bring to my holy mountain,\
> and make them joyful in my house of prayer;\
> their burnt offerings and their sacrifices\
> will be accepted on my altar;\
> for my house shall be called a house of prayer\
> for all peoples.”\
> [8] The Lord GOD,\
> who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares,\
> “I will gather yet others to him\
> besides those already gathered.”

## Epistle [Rm 11:1‑2a, 13‑15, 28‑32 ESV]

[1] I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. [2a] God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.

[13] Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry [14] in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. [15] For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?

[28] As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. [29] For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. [30] For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, [31] so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. [32] For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 15:21‑28 ESV; sermon text]

[21] And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. [22] And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.” [23] But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying out after us.” [24] He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” [25] But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.” [26] And he answered, “It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” [27] She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.” [28] Then Jesus answered her, “O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed instantly.

[21] Καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐκεῖθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὰ μέρη Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος. 
[22] καὶ ἰδοὺ γυνὴ Χαναναία ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων ἐκείνων ἐξελθοῦσα ἔκραζεν λέγουσα, Ἐλέησόν με, κύριε, υἱὸς Δαυίδ: ἡ θυγάτηρ μου κακῶς δαιμονίζεται. 
[23] ὁ δὲ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῇ λόγον. καὶ προσελθόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ἠρώτουν αὐτὸν λέγοντες, Ἀπόλυσον αὐτήν, ὅτι κράζει ὄπισθεν ἡμῶν. 
[24] ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν, Οὐκ ἀπεστάλην εἰ μὴ εἰς τὰ πρόβατα τὰ ἀπολωλότα οἴκου Ἰσραήλ. 
[25] ἡ δὲ ἐλθοῦσα προσεκύνει αὐτῷ λέγουσα, Κύριε, βοήθει μοι. 
[26] ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν, Οὐκ ἔστιν καλὸν λαβεῖν τὸν ἄρτον τῶν τέκνων καὶ βαλεῖν τοῖς κυναρίοις. 
[27] ἡ δὲ εἶπεν, Ναί, κύριε, καὶ γὰρ τὰ κυνάρια ἐσθίει ἀπὸ τῶν ψιχίων τῶν πιπτόντων ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης τῶν κυρίων αὐτῶν. 
[28] τότε ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῇ, *)=ω γύναι, μεγάλη σου ἡ πίστις: γενηθήτω σοι ὡς θέλεις. καὶ ἰάθη ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ τῆς ὥρας ἐκείνης.

## Introit [Ps 28:1-2, 6-7; antiphon: Ps 28:8]

> The LORD is the strength of his | people;\*\
> he is the saving refuge of his a- | nointed.\
> To you, O LORD, I call; my rock, be not | deaf to me,\*\
> lest, if you be silent to me, I become like those who go down | to the pit.\
> Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy, when I cry to | you for help,\*\
> when I lift up my hands toward your most holy sanctu- | ary.\
> Blessed | be the LORD!\*\
> for he has heard the voice of my pleas for | mercy.\
> The LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and | I am helped;\*\
> my heart exults, and with my song I give | thanks to him.\
