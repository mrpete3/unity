## Old Testament [1Ki 19:1‑8 ESV]

[1] Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. [2] Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.” [3] Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.

[4] But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.” [5] And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, “Arise and eat.” [6] And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. [7] And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, “Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.” [8] And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.

## Epistle [Eph 4:17‑5:2 ESV; sermon text]

[17] Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds.
[18] They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. [19] They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.
[20] But that is not the way you learned Christ!—[21] assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
[22] to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, [23] and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, [24] and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.

[25] Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. [26] Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, [27] and give no opportunity to the devil. [28] Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. [29] Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. [30] And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. [31] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. [32] Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.

[1] Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. [2] And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

[17] Τοῦτο οὖν λέγω καὶ μαρτύρομαι ἐν κυρίῳ, μηκέτι ὑμᾶς περιπατεῖν καθὼς καὶ τὰ ἔθνη περιπατεῖ ἐν ματαιότητι τοῦ νοὸς αὐτῶν, 
[18] ἐσκοτωμένοι τῇ διανοίᾳ ὄντες, ἀπηλλοτριωμένοι τῆς ζωῆς τοῦ θεοῦ, διὰ τὴν ἄγνοιαν τὴν οὖσαν ἐν αὐτοῖς, διὰ τὴν πώρωσιν τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν, 
[19] οἵτινες ἀπηλγηκότες ἑαυτοὺς παρέδωκαν τῇ ἀσελγείᾳ εἰς ἐργασίαν ἀκαθαρσίας πάσης ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ. 
[20] ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως ἐμάθετε τὸν Χριστόν, 
[21] εἴ γε αὐτὸν ἠκούσατε καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐδιδάχθητε, καθώς ἐστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ, 
[22] ἀποθέσθαι ὑμᾶς κατὰ τὴν προτέραν ἀναστροφὴν τὸν παλαιὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν φθειρόμενον κατὰ τὰς ἐπιθυμίας τῆς ἀπάτης, 
[23] ἀνανεοῦσθαι δὲ τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ νοὸς ὑμῶν, 
[24] καὶ ἐνδύσασθαι τὸν καινὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν κατὰ θεὸν κτισθέντα ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ὁσιότητι τῆς ἀληθείας. 

[25] Διὸ ἀποθέμενοι τὸ ψεῦδος λαλεῖτε ἀλήθειαν ἕκαστος μετὰ τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐσμὲν ἀλλήλων μέλη. 
[26] ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε: ὁ ἥλιος μὴ ἐπιδυέτω ἐπὶ [τῷ] παροργισμῷ ὑμῶν, 
[27] μηδὲ δίδοτε τόπον τῷ διαβόλῳ. 
[28] ὁ κλέπτων μηκέτι κλεπτέτω, μᾶλλον δὲ κοπιάτω ἐργαζόμενος ταῖς [ἰδίαις] χερσὶν τὸ ἀγαθόν, ἵνα ἔχῃ μεταδιδόναι τῷ χρείαν ἔχοντι. 
[29] πᾶς λόγος σαπρὸς ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν μὴ ἐκπορευέσθω, ἀλλὰ εἴ τις ἀγαθὸς πρὸς οἰκοδομὴν τῆς χρείας, ἵνα δῷ χάριν τοῖς ἀκούουσιν. 
[30] καὶ μὴ λυπεῖτε τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον τοῦ θεοῦ, ἐν ᾧ ἐσφραγίσθητε εἰς ἡμέραν ἀπολυτρώσεως. 
[31] πᾶσα πικρία καὶ θυμὸς καὶ ὀργὴ καὶ κραυγὴ καὶ βλασφημία ἀρθήτω ἀφ' ὑμῶν σὺν πάσῃ κακίᾳ. 
[32] γίνεσθε [δὲ] εἰς ἀλλήλους χρηστοί, εὔσπλαγχνοι, χαριζόμενοι ἑαυτοῖς καθὼς καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἐν Χριστῷ ἐχαρίσατο ὑμῖν.

[1] γίνεσθε οὖν μιμηταὶ τοῦ θεοῦ, ὡς τέκνα ἀγαπητά,
[2] καὶ περιπατεῖτε ἐν ἀγάπῃ, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς καὶ παρέδωκεν ἑαυτὸν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν προσφορὰν καὶ θυσίαν τῷ θεῷ εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 6:35‑51 ESV]

[35] Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. [36] But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. [37] All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. [38] For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. [39] And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. [40] For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”

[41] So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” [42] They said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” [43] Jesus answered them, “Do not grumble among yourselves. [44] No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. [45] It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—[46] not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. [47] Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. [48] I am the bread of life. [49] Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. [50] This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. [51] I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”

## Collect

Gracious Father, Your blessed Son came down from heaven to be the true bread that gives life to the world. Grant that Christ, the bread of life, may live in us and we in Him, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Our Epistle readings continue in Ephesians; as you know, the Ephesian congregation is known for having both Jew and Gentile members---people who once were at odds with each other and even enemies are now one body, the body of Christ.
**"The Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the _same body_, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel"** ([Eph 3:6](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+3:6/) ESV).

But what about the Gentiles?
What is there not to love about the Gentiles in the first place?
What is not to love is that they are offensive people, and so were we before Christ saved us.
The Ephesians are told,
**"You must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds."**
One thing offensive about the Gentiles is the futility of their minds.
Allow me to remind you of what our Lord tells us about speaking about other people:

> **"Whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire."** ([Mt 5:22](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5:22/)).

A stern warning, indeed, from our Lord *not* to call anyone a fool.
St. Paul salts his words and states that the Gentiles are not fools but *walk in the futility of their minds*.
(You may use that the next time you are tempted to call anyone a fool.)
Paul tells us that the Gentiles, as a class of people, have this problem.

> **They are darkened in their understanding.**

They do not *get it*.
They might know that a table costs $20 and they only have ten in their pocket, but they buy it on credit and get into financial trouble.
They might want to eat but they do not want to work.
These are examples of a darkened understanding.

> **They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.**

A darkened understanding means you drift away from the life of God---from godly living---and your heart is hardened.
Now, the hardening of the heart is simple: God says, "This is how it is," and we say, "No, it's not."
God speaks with authority and we assert ourselves as our own god against His Word.

*Sensuality*, means *sexually unrestrained*.
That, frankly, is the hallmark of Gentile living.
Sexual sin is one of the main symptoms of a darkened understanding and a hardened heart,
where marriage is mocked and whatever turns you on is what you do.
Welcome to Gentile living!

> **But that is not the way you learned Christ!**

When Jesus comes, He changes who you are, and that includes your thinking.

> **But that is not the way you learned Christ!---assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus.**

The truth in Jesus crashed into your life on the day you were baptized, when you literally put off you old self and put on your new self.
(What a glorious thing it is to remember you own Baptism and _[Point to font.]_ witness someone else's.) 

> **What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.**

> **For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.**

> **Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.** ([Rm 6:1‑14](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6:1/) ESV)

> **In Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.** (ESV)

The truth that we are one body in Jesus is as certain as we partake of Holy Communion together.

> **The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.** ([1Co 10:16‑17](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10:16/) ESV)

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

## Notes

Eph 4:22‑23. You have got to mention Baptism ([Rm 6:1‑14](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6:1/); [Gal 3:26‑27](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+3:26/)).
Even read all of Rm 6:1‑14 aloud and the 4th Part on Baptism in the Small Catechism.

Eph 4:26‑28. Anger is an opportunity for the devil.
Honest work drives away opportunities for the devil.

Eph 4:28. This isn't listed as a spiritual gift---to work and not steal---but here it is, listed as the life of the one who has put on Christ.
