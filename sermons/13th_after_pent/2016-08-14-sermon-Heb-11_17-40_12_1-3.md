## Old Testament [Jer 23:16-29 ESV]

[16] Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. [17] They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, ‘It shall be well with you’; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, ‘No disaster shall come upon you.’”

> [18] For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD  
> to see and to hear his word,  
> or who has paid attention to his word and listened?  
> [19] Behold, the storm of the LORD!  
> Wrath has gone forth,	a whirling tempest;  
> it will burst upon the head of the wicked.  
> [20] The anger of the LORD will not turn back  
> until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his heart.  
> In the latter days you will understand it clearly.
	
> [21] “I did not send the prophets, yet they ran;  
> I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.  
> [22] But if they had stood in my council,  
> then they would have proclaimed my words to my people,  
> and they would have turned them from their evil way,  
> and from the evil of their deeds.  

[23] “Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God far away? [24] Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD. [25] I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ [26] How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart, [27] who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal? [28] Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD. [29] Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?

## Epistle [Heb 11:17-40; 12:1‑3 ESV; sermon text]

[17] By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. [20] By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. [21] By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. [22] By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.

[23] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. [24] By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, [25] choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. [26] He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. [27] By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. [28] By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.

[29] By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned. [30] By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. [31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.

[32] And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—[33] who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, [34] quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. [35] Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. [36] Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. [37] They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—[38] of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

[39] And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, [40] since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.

[12:1] Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, [2] looking to Jesus, the founder and perfector of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. [3] Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.

[17] Πίστει προσενήνοχεν Ἀβραὰμ τὸν Ἰσαὰκ πειραζόμενος καὶ τὸν μονογενῆ προσέφερεν, ὁ τὰς ἐπαγγελίας ἀναδεξάμενος,
[18] πρὸς ὃν ἐλαλήθη ὅτι ἐν Ἰσαὰκ κληθήσεταί σοι σπέρμα,
[19] λογισάμενος ὅτι καὶ ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐγείρειν δυνατὸς ὁ θεός, ὅθεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν παραβολῇ ἐκομίσατο.
[20] Πίστει καὶ περὶ μελλόντων εὐλόγησεν Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἰακὼβ καὶ τὸν Ἠσαῦ.
[21] Πίστει Ἰακὼβ ἀποθνῄσκων ἕκαστον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰωσὴφ εὐλόγησεν καὶ
προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ.
[22] Πίστει Ἰωσὴφ τελευτῶν περὶ τῆς ἐξόδου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐμνημόνευσεν καὶ περὶ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτοῦ ἐνετείλατο.

[23] Πίστει Μωϋσῆς γεννηθεὶς ἐκρύβη τρίμηνον ὑπὸ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, διότι εἶδον ἀστεῖον τὸ παιδίον καὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸ διάταγμα τοῦ βασιλέως. 
[24] Πίστει Μωϋσῆς μέγας γενόμενος ἠρνήσατο λέγεσθαι υἱὸς θυγατρὸς Φαραώ,
[25] μᾶλλον ἑλόμενος συγκακουχεῖσθαι τῷ λαῷ τοῦ θεοῦ ἢ πρόσκαιρον ἔχειν ἁμαρτίας ἀπόλαυσιν,
[26] μείζονα πλοῦτον ἡγησάμενος τῶν Αἰγύπτου θησαυρῶν τὸν ὀνειδισμὸν τοῦ Χριστοῦ· ἀπέβλεπεν γὰρ εἰς τὴν μισθαποδοσίαν. 
[27] Πίστει κατέλιπεν Αἴγυπτον μὴ φοβηθεὶς τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ βασιλέως· τὸν γὰρ ἀόρατον ὡς ὁρῶν ἐκαρτέρησεν.
[28] Πίστει πεποίηκεν τὸ πάσχα καὶ τὴν πρόσχυσιν τοῦ αἵματος, ἵνα μὴ ὁ ὀλοθρεύων τὰ πρωτότοκα θίγῃ αὐτῶν.

[29] Πίστει διέβησαν τὴν ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν ὡς διὰ ξηρᾶς γῆς, ἧς πεῖραν λαβόντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι κατεπόθησαν. 
[30] Πίστει τὰ τείχη Ἰεριχὼ ἔπεσαν κυκλωθέντα ἐπὶ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας.
[31] Πίστει Ῥαὰβ ἡ πόρνη οὐ συναπώλετο τοῖς ἀπειθήσασιν δεξαμένη τοὺς κατασκόπους μετ’ εἰρήνης.

[32] Καὶ τί ἔτι λέγω; ἐπιλείψει με γὰρ διηγούμενον ὁ χρόνος περὶ Γεδεών, Βαράκ, Σαμψών, Ἰεφθάε, Δαυίδ τε καὶ Σαμουὴλ καὶ τῶν προφητῶν,
[33] οἳ διὰ πίστεως κατηγωνίσαντο βασιλείας, εἰργάσαντο δικαιοσύνην, ἐπέτυχον ἐπαγγελιῶν, ἔφραξαν στόματα λεόντων,
[34] ἔσβεσαν δύναμιν πυρός, ἔφυγον στόματα μαχαίρης, ἐδυναμώθησαν ἀπὸ ἀσθενείας, ἐγενήθησαν ἰσχυροὶ ἐν πολέμῳ, παρεμβολὰς ἔκλιναν ἀλλοτρίων. 
[35] Ἔλαβον γυναῖκες ἐξ ἀναστάσεως τοὺς νεκροὺς αὐτῶν· ἄλλοι δὲ ἐτυμπανίσθησαν οὐ προσδεξάμενοι τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν, ἵνα κρείττονος ἀναστάσεως τύχωσιν·
[36] ἕτεροι δὲ ἐμπαιγμῶν καὶ μαστίγων πεῖραν ἔλαβον, ἔτι δὲ δεσμῶν καὶ φυλακῆς·
[37] ἐλιθάσθησαν, ἐπρίσθησαν, ἐν φόνῳ μαχαίρης ἀπέθανον, περιῆλθον ἐν μηλωταῖς, ἐν αἰγείοις δέρμασιν, ὑστερούμενοι, θλιβόμενοι, κακουχούμενοι,
[38] ὧν οὐκ ἦν ἄξιος ὁ κόσμος, ἐπὶ ἐρημίαις πλανώμενοι καὶ ὄρεσιν καὶ σπηλαίοις καὶ ταῖς ὀπαῖς τῆς γῆς. 

[39]Καὶ οὗτοι πάντες μαρτυρηθέντες διὰ τῆς πίστεως οὐκ ἐκομίσαντο τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν,
[40] τοῦ θεοῦ περὶ ἡμῶν κρεῖττόν τι προβλεψαμένου, ἵνα μὴ χωρὶς ἡμῶν τελειωθῶσιν.

[12:1] Τοιγαροῦν καὶ ἡμεῖς τοσοῦτον ἔχοντες περικείμενον ἡμῖν νέφος μαρτύρων, ὄγκον ἀποθέμενοι πάντα καὶ τὴν εὐπερίστατον ἁμαρτίαν, δι’ ὑπομονῆς τρέχωμεν τὸν προκείμενον ἡμῖν ἀγῶνα
[2] ἀφορῶντες εἰς τὸν τῆς πίστεως ἀρχηγὸν καὶ τελειωτὴν Ἰησοῦν, ὃς ἀντὶ τῆς προκειμένης αὐτῷ χαρᾶς ὑπέμεινεν σταυρὸν αἰσχύνης καταφρονήσας ἐν δεξιᾷ τε τοῦ θρόνου τοῦ θεοῦ κεκάθικεν.
[3] ἀναλογίσασθε γὰρ τὸν τοιαύτην ὑπομεμενηκότα ὑπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἀντιλογίαν, ἵνα μὴ κάμητε ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν ἐκλυόμενοι.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 12:49-56 ESV]

[49] “I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled! [50] I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished! [51] Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. [52] For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three. [53] They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”

[54] He also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A shower is coming.’ And so it happens. [55] And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ and it happens. [56] You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?”

[51] δοκεῖτε ὅτι εἰρήνην παρεγενόμην δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ; οὐχί, λέγω ὑμῖν, ἀλλ’ ἢ διαμερισμόν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, it may seem like this summer everything happened in Cleveland.
But in the Bible, everything&mdash;you could say&mdash;happened on Mount Moriah.
You heard about old Abraham last week, the man who believed everything the LORD told him.
And the LORD counted Abraham's faith as righteousness [(Gn&nbsp;15:6)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2015%3A6/).
The LORD had promised Abraham, you may recall, that his seed would be as many as the stars in heaven, even though he and Sarah were old and had no children. But Abraham believed it&mdash;&ldquo;God said it, I believe it, that settles it&rdquo;&mdash;and _it happened_: his long-awaited son, Isaac, was born.
But that was _twenty years_&mdash;Abraham had to wait _twenty years_ after God promised before that promise began to show fruit.
It was not until Abraham was 100 and Sarah was 90 that Isaac was born.
And that was the birth of _one child_, a son.
&ldquo;As many as the stars of heaven&rdquo;?
That would have to wait.

Abraham now has his promised son, Isaac.
What an amazing thing it would be to be a 100-year-old _father_ playing with my infant son&mdash;the one God promised me!
But then God tested Abraham:

> **&ldquo;Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of _Moriah_, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&rdquo;** [(Gn&nbsp;22:2 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2022%3A2/)


This is the first we hear in the Bible about Mount Moriah.
The LORD's command is for Abraham to take his son&mdash;the son of God's own promise&mdash;the son so faithfully believed that he would indeed be born according to God's promise&mdash;take Isaac to Mount Moriah and kill him there and offer him as a burnt offering.

Now at this point, I would not blame Abraham if he said,
&ldquo;No, God would never do that! God would never take away someone or something so dear to me.&rdquo;
But beloved in the Lord, do not doubt Him!
Whatever He says, stands!
Whatever He does He does for the good of those who love Him!
God forbid, but in our weak minds we create our own idols of what God would and would not say&mdash;what God would and would not do.
And in this sinful frame of mind, we are tempted to listen to and are inclined to flock to false prophets who speak out of _their_ minds and not from the Word of God.
You heard this in the Old Testament reading:

> **Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.** [(Jer&nbsp;23:16)](http://www.esvbible.org/Jeremiah%2023%3A16/)

How, then, do we know it is from the mouth of the LORD?
It is written in the Bible.
How do we know that the Bible is those very words from the mouth of the LORD?
In short, because Jesus says so [(Mt&nbsp;5:17&#x2011;20)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%205%3A17-20/) and I trust Jesus because He was killed in punishment for my sins and resurrected to declare me innocent before God just as the Bible says He would be.
Jesus has done me no wrong, Jesus has done you no wrong.
I invite you to trust His Word and set your own opinions to the side and see what happens.
He works all things for good for those who love Him.

But returning now to Abraham on Mount Moriah with Isaac, this is one of the most troubling passages of the Bible.
(I know it troubled my children.)
It is even contradictory for God to command a child to be sacrificed where elsewhere in the Bible He says that this is forbidden [(Lv&nbsp;20:1‑2)](http://www.esvbible.org/Leviticus%2020%3A1-2/).
It begs the question: what was going through God's mind?
It also begs the question: what was going through Abraham's mind?

To answer the question of what was going on in Abraham's mind, turn to today's Epistle reading from Hebrews, chapter&nbsp;11. Here is what was going through Abraham's mind:

> **By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, of whom it was said, &ldquo;Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.&rdquo;**

Abraham is still trusting God!
You may recall that Isaac said, **&ldquo;My father!&rdquo;**

**&ldquo;Here I am, my son.&rdquo;**

**&ldquo;Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&rdquo;**

Abraham said, **&ldquo;God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.&rdquo;** [(Gn&nbsp;22:7‑8)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2022%3A7-8/)

Beloved in the Lord, trusting God never fails!
Our Epistle reading reveals more of what Abraham was thinking:

> **[Abraham] considered that God was able even to raise [Isaac] from the dead.**

So there you have it.
Abraham was going to go through with the sacrifice because God told him to do it.
He fully expected to kill is beloved son, Isaac, and that God would raise Isaac from the dead _because_&mdash;do you remember this?&mdash;God had made a promise about Isaac:

> **&ldquo;Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant _with him_ as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.&rdquo;** [(Gn&nbsp;17:19 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis+17:19/)

The second time Moriah is mentioned in the Bible is in 2&nbsp;Chronicles, chapter&nbsp;3:

> **Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.** [(2Ch&nbsp;3:1)](http://www.esvbible.org/2+Chronicles+3:1/)

Beloved in the Lord, now you see what was going through God's mind on Mount Moriah.
This same mountain on which Abraham was to sacrifice his son, Isaac _is_ the same mountain on which God _did_ sacrifice His only Son, Jesus, for the forgivness of your sins.

I all happened on Mount Moriah. AMEN.
