## Old Testament [Jer 15:15‑21 ESV]

> [15] O LORD, you know;\
> remember me and visit me,\
> and take vengeance for me on my persecutors.\
> In your forbearance take me not away;\
> know that for your sake I bear reproach.\
> [16] Your words were found, and I ate them,\
> and your words became to me a joy\
> and the delight of my heart,\
> for I am called by your name,\
> O LORD, God of hosts.\
> [17] I did not sit in the company of revelers,\
> nor did I rejoice;\
> I sat alone, because your hand was upon me,\
> for you had filled me with indignation.\
> [18] Why is my pain unceasing,\
> my wound incurable,\
> refusing to be healed?\
> Will you be to me like a deceitful brook,\
> like waters that fail?


> [19] Therefore thus says the LORD:\
> “If you return, I will restore you,\
> and you shall stand before me.\
> If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless,\
> you shall be as my mouth.\
> They shall turn to you,\
> but you shall not turn to them.\
> [20] And I will make you to this people\
> a fortified wall of bronze;\
> they will fight against you,\
> but they shall not prevail over you,\
> for I am with you\
> to save you and deliver you,\
> declares the LORD.\
> [21] I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,\
> and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.”

## Epistle [Rm 12:9‑21 ESV]

[9] Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. [10] Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. [11] Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. [12] Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. [13] Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.

[14] Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. [15] Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. [16] Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. [17] Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. [18] If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. [19] Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” [20] To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” [21] Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 16:21‑28 ESV; sermon text]

[21] From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. [22] And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.” [23] But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”

[24] Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. [25] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. [26] For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul? [27] For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done. [28] Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”

## Collect

Almighty God, Your Son willingly endured the agony and shame of the cross for our redemption. Grant us courage to take up our cross daily and follow Him wherever He leads; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Hymns

* Opening hymn: _TSC_ 213 _I Love Thy Kingdom, Lord_
* Sermon hymn: _TSC_ 492 _Must Jesus Bear the Cross Alone?_
* Closing hymn: _TSC_ 371 _"Take Up Your Cross," the Savior Said_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, Jesus asked His disciples, **"But who do _you_ say that I am?" Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God"** [(Mt 16:15‑16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+16/).
That is the main point from last week's sermon, but it is no less the *main point of the Bible*.
Jesus is **the Christ, the Son of the living God**.
*The Christ* has to do with the promised Savior from the Old Testament;
*the Son of the living God* appears to us in flesh in the New Testament;
yes, Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God *is* the main point of the Bible.
Will we now move on from the main point of the Bible?
No, we will *hold onto it* with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our might (Dt 6:5).
Jesus is **the Christ, the Son of the living God**.

But now, in today's Holy Gospel, does *Jesus* step away from the main point of the Bible?
No. Of course not. He never does.
Our Holy Gospel today continues from last week:

> **From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, _and be killed_, and on the third day be raised.**

If Jesus is so wonderful, being the Christ, the Son of the living God, why must He be killed and why must He talk about it?
It is like being drafted number one and talking about how you are going to lose.
Beloved in the Lord, you are now face-to-face not only with the main point of the Bible, but with *the way in which* the main point of the Bible is presented to us.

Advertising.
Advertising is the way in which an idea is presented.
You understand advertising very well: someone is constantly presenting a product to you with the intention to make you want it for yourself.
"Corn Flakes will keep you young, so buy a box and eat them."
That is advertising.
The main idea almost never changes: "make you younger, make your life better."
Yet in our Holy Gospel today, Jesus says that He, the Christ, the Son of the living God must be *killed* and that *you*, His disciple must *deny* yourself, take up *your* Cross, and follow *Him*.

"That is no way to advertise."
But, beloved in the Lord, what may be true in the world may be falsehood in the kingdom of God.
Yes, Satan has interfered with what goes on in the world; he thinks he controls the world.
You remember well his false advertising in the Garden of Eden: "**You will not surely die** if you eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. No, you will *live*---you will become *wise* like God, knowing the difference between good and evil" [(Gn 3:1‑5)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3/).

> **So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.** [(Gn 3:6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3/)

The truth is that what Satan advertises as life is, in fact, *death*; it is just as true today as it was in the Garden of Eden.
"You will have more life if you have more money.
You will have more life if you have a physically intimate relationship with someone to whom you are not married."
Satan has sold life from the beginning, but as our Lord Jesus plainly says, **"He was a _murderer_ from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him "** [(Jn 8:44 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+8/).
Satan, by his very nature, even though he sells life, *can only bring death*---he has been a murderer from the beginning.
So beware of what the world advertises.

But Jesus is the Author of *Life* (Ac 3:15). He advertises His own death---that He must suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed---but adds that on the third day he will be raised *from* the dead.
Jesus cannot lie, *and even if He advertises death He brings **life** from it*.

However, Satan has blinded Peter to this essential truth. Peter *rebukes* Jesus, **“Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.”**
Jesus recognizes that Peter has been blinded by Satan and says, **“Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”**
And please, beloved in the Lord, take note: the things of man are the things of Satan.
And has not our Lord warned you not to be choked by the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of this world (Mt 13:22)?
Satan is behind it all; do not fall for his false advertising.

For our Lord Jesus has in truth *suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. The third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.*
His death has been swallowed up in life---not only for Him but for all who trust in Him---for all who trust that *His* death on the Cross was *your* death in punishment for your sin.

Jesus has delivered on His promise, and though He advertises a cross for you to take up and follow Him, there is guaranteed *life* for you at the end.
Welcome to Christ's advertising, which is no marketing ploy:

> **"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."**

This is the life-giving truth.
AMEN.
