## Old Testament [Pr 9:1‑10 ESV]

> [1] Wisdom has built her house;\
> she has hewn her seven pillars.\
> [2] She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine;\
> she has also set her table.\
> [3] She has sent out her young women to call\
> from the highest places in the town,\
> [4] “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”\
> To him who lacks sense she says,\
> [5] “Come, eat of my bread\
> and drink of the wine I have mixed.\
> [6] Leave your simple ways, and live,\
> and walk in the way of insight.”

> [7] Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,\
> and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.\
> [8] Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;\
> reprove a wise man, and he will love you.\
> [9] Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;\
> teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.\
> [10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,\
> and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.

## Epistle [Eph 5:6‑21 ESV; sermon text]

[6] Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. [7] Therefore do not become partners with them; [8] for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light [9] (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), [10] and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. [11] Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. [12] For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. [13] But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, [14] for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,

> “Awake, O sleeper,\
> and arise from the dead,\
> and Christ will shine on you.”

[15] Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
[16] making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.
[17] Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. [18] And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, [19] addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, [20] giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, [21] submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.

[6] Μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς ἀπατάτω κενοῖς λόγοις, διὰ ταῦτα γὰρ ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῆς ἀπειθείας. 
[7] μὴ οὖν γίνεσθε συμμέτοχοι αὐτῶν: 
[8] ἦτε γάρ ποτε σκότος, νῦν δὲ φῶς ἐν κυρίῳ: ὡς τέκνα φωτὸς περιπατεῖτε 
[9] ὁ γὰρ καρπὸς τοῦ φωτὸς ἐν πάσῃ ἀγαθωσύνῃ καὶ δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ 
[10] δοκιμάζοντες τί ἐστιν εὐάρεστον τῷ κυρίῳ: 
[11] καὶ μὴ συγκοινωνεῖτε τοῖς ἔργοις τοῖς ἀκάρποις τοῦ σκότους, μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ ἐλέγχετε, 
[12] τὰ γὰρ κρυφῇ γινόμενα ὑπ' αὐτῶν αἰσχρόν ἐστιν καὶ λέγειν: 
[13] τὰ δὲ πάντα ἐλεγχόμενα ὑπὸ τοῦ φωτὸς φανεροῦται, 
[14] πᾶν γὰρ τὸ φανερούμενον φῶς ἐστιν. διὸ λέγει,

> Ἔγειρε, ὁ καθεύδων, καὶ ἀνάστα ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν, καὶ ἐπιφαύσει σοι ὁ Χριστός. 

[15] Βλέπετε οὖν ἀκριβῶς πῶς περιπατεῖτε, μὴ ὡς ἄσοφοι ἀλλ' ὡς σοφοί, 
[16] ἐξαγοραζόμενοι τὸν καιρόν, ὅτι αἱ ἡμέραι πονηραί εἰσιν. 
[17] διὰ τοῦτο μὴ γίνεσθε ἄφρονες, ἀλλὰ συνίετε τί τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου. 
[18] καὶ μὴ μεθύσκεσθε οἴνῳ, ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ἀσωτία, ἀλλὰ πληροῦσθε ἐν πνεύματι, 
[19] λαλοῦντες ἑαυτοῖς [ἐν] ψαλμοῖς καὶ ὕμνοις καὶ ᾠδαῖς πνευματικαῖς, ᾄδοντες καὶ ψάλλοντες τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν τῷ κυρίῳ, 
[20] εὐχαριστοῦντες πάντοτε ὑπὲρ πάντων ἐν ὀνόματι τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῷ θεῷ καὶ πατρί, 
[21] ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις ἐν φόβῳ Χριστοῦ.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 6:51‑69 ESV]

[51] I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.” 

[52] The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 
[53] So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 
[54] Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. 
[55] For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 
[56] Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. 
[57] As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. 
[58] This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” 
[59] Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum. 

[60] When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?” 
[61] But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, “Do you take offense at this? 
[62] Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 
[63] It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 
[64] But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 
[65] And he said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.” 

[66] After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. 
[67] So Jesus said to the twelve, “Do you want to go away as well?” 
[68] Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, 
[69] and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
The school year is upon us and I, again, will be teaching.
I will teach math to fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth-graders at Holy Cross Lutheran School, thank be to God!
I can't wait.
Now imagine fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth-graders.
When they are *not* being outstanding students, diligently doing their work, what do you think they do?
They waste time---some of them, not all of them.

"Mr. Pirn, I left my folder in my book bag."

Let him go to get that folder out of his book bag and watch him stroll across the gym---not even in a straight line---and when he gets to his book bag, he fumbles with the zipper for two minutes, and when he pulls out that folder something falls out of there onto the floor.
Oh no!
How are you ever going to quickly put that fallen eraser back in your book bag?
Can't be done---that involves bending over.
It takes a while, but the student does manage to put that eraser back in his book bag.
Then he has to walk all the way back across the gym and to the classroom, and what do you know?
He sees his friend in the hallway and that starts something new, at the end of which something really funny must have happened because now they are both bent over laughing.
In the time it took him to get his folder out of his book bag, he could have finished half of his homework assignment.

Not that we adults ever waste our time.
Beloved in the Lord, this is the Sunday where St. Paul tells us in our Epistle reading, **"Make the best use of the time, because the days are evil."**
Have you ever wasted any time in these evil days?
Let the apostle remind you that **"at one time you were darkness"**---you were a slave of the devil fulfilling his desires while you fullfilled your own.
Whatever felt good at that time just kept going and going for days and weeks and months and years.
Think of that time---and what did it get you?
Could you use that time if you had it now?
And what would you do?
I would trust Jesus and let Him direct how I use my time.

But that hurts---just the time wasted in sin.
But thanks be to God for His Commandments, for they come to our rescue when we are wasting time sinning---they let us know we are sinning and this needs to stop now!

> **You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.**

Have you ever engaged in speech that does not show respect to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit?
God forbid that you would ever get *anywhere close* to speaking badly of the Spirit, for Jesus warns,
**"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven"** ([Lk 12:10](https://www.esv.org/Luke+12:10/) ESV).

> **Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.**

Let us be glad because at this very moment we *are* dedicated to the Word of God on the Sabbath as we should be.
But let us pray, "Gracious Father, there are many who are not in church at this time and may not be concerned at all with Your Word and rest. Please, by your Holy Spirit draw burdened sinners to rest in Your Son Jesus and bring them here on the Sabbath to hear Your Word and to receive your Son's body and blood for the forgiveness of their sins. Amen."

> **Honor your father and your mother.**

This commandment, by the way, does not say, "Honor your father and mother only if you like them."
God's Word---God's Word makes everything holy that it touches.
Like the Sabbath day---just any day of the week, but if it is dedicated by God's Word and for God's Word, it is greater than all the other days.
For each of you, there is only one man whom God named *father* and one woman whom God named *mother*.
If a sinful person stands behind those names, remember nevertheless the name that God gave them.
The catechism explains that we should not despise our parents *and other authorities*, which includes teachers.
Since I started with the subject of school, consider what became of your time if you ever rebelled against your parents and teachers---years and years may have been flushed.

> **You shall not murder.**

Your neighbor was created in God's image, and his blood is not for you to shed unless God has called you to serve in the military or law enforcement.
Today, even in this community, we live in fear of those who are *not* police officers or in the military who do not hesitate to shed their neighbor's blood or harm his body, often while they is breaking the Seventh Commandment: **You shall not steal.**
The shedding of blood by called police officers is today also called into question and a serious subject of intense interest.
Think of the time.
What else could be we doing of there was not problem with breaking the Fifth Commandment?

> **You shall not commit adultery.**

St. Paul takes straight aim at sexually unrestrained living, which I brought up last Sunday.
See for yourself that Satan has successfully promoted sexually unrestrained living for generations.
Where has it gotten us?
God's intention for sexuality is the exclusive physical union of *one* man and his *one* wife.
The man is not even to look lustfully on a woman who is not his wife.
There is much more than that going on, and, God forbid, you may have participated in it.
According to this commandment, was that a good use of your time?
How much time is spent indulging in pornography?
How much time is spent on sexual relations that are not marriage?
Going back to what goes on in school,
if every child in school had both mom and dad married and living at home in holy wedlock,
how much less inclined would those children be to waste time?
The waste of time is mind-boggling.

> **You shall not steal.**

Did you know there were even more commandments than that?

"I don't have time. I'm in a hurry."
If you had never wasted your time in sin, how much of a hurry would be in today?
Consider it and cry.

This, beloved in the Lord, where Jesus jumps in.
Not only have you wasted your time sinning, but you deserve to die for your sin.

> *Savior, Thy dying love*\
> *Thou gavest me.*

Jesus died as our substitute; _[Point to the Crucifixion window.]_ He died on the Cross.
His love for us is revealed in willingly dying because He saw that we were going to die in our sins.
Back in the Old Testament, why did God command the Israelites to destroy every man, woman, and child in Canaan?
Because they were sinners and deserved to die.
We were going to die in our sins like the Canaanites of old, and our merciful Father could not stand it, so He sent His Son Jesus to die in our place.
His death is our gift: now we will not die.

The Spirit invites you to believe this and take it into your heart---that Jesus died so you can live.
Its effect is like a beam of light.

If you planted a seed and watered it and left it in the dark, what would that be?
That is your life in sin.
You sprout and you rot.

But if you planted a seed and watered it and she sun shined on it, what would *that* be?
Beloved in the Lord, let the Son---S‑O‑N---shine on you!

> “Awake, O sleeper,\
> and arise from the dead,\
> and Christ will shine on you.”

You will waste your time sinning no more.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
