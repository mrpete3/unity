## Old Testament [Is 66:18-23 ESV]

[18] “For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory, [19] and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations. [20] And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD. [21] And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.

> [22] “For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make  
> shall remain before me, says the LORD,  
> so shall your offspring and your name remain.  
> [23] From new moon to new moon,  
> and from Sabbath to Sabbath,  
> all flesh shall come to worship before me,  
> declares the LORD.

[18] κἀγὼ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν καὶ τὸν λογισμὸν αὐτῶν ἐπίσταμαι. ἔρχομαι συναγαγεῖν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη καὶ τὰς γλώσσας, καὶ ἥξουσιν καὶ ὄψονται τὴν δόξαν μου.
[19] καὶ καταλείψω ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν σημεῖα καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ἐξ αὐτῶν σεσῳσμένους εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, εἰς Θαρσις καὶ Φουδ καὶ Λουδ καὶ Μοσοχ καὶ Θοβελ καὶ εἰς τὴν ῾Ελλάδα καὶ εἰς τὰς νήσους τὰς πόρρω, οἳ οὐκ ἀκηκόασίν μου τὸ ὄνομα οὐδὲ ἑωράκασιν τὴν δόξαν μου, καὶ ἀναγγελοῦσίν μου τὴν δόξαν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν.
[20] καὶ ἄξουσιν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν δῶρον κυρίῳ μεθ᾽ ἵππων καὶ ἁρμάτων ἐν λαμπήναις ἡμιόνων μετὰ σκιαδίων εἰς τὴν ἁγίαν πόλιν Ιερουσαλημ, εἶπεν κύριος, ὡς ἂν ἐνέγκαισαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐμοὶ τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν μετὰ ψαλμῶν εἰς τὸν οἶκον κυρίου.
[21] καὶ ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν λήμψομαι ἐμοὶ ἱερεῖς καὶ Λευίτας, εἶπεν κύριος.

> [22] ὃν τρόπον γὰρ ὁ οὐρανὸς καινὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ καινή, ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, μένει ἐνώπιόν μου, λέγει κύριος, οὕτως στήσεται τὸ σπέρμα ὑμῶν καὶ τὸ ὄνομα ὑμῶν.  
> [23] καὶ ἔσται μῆνα ἐκ μηνὸς καὶ σάββατον ἐκ σαββάτου ἥξει πᾶσα σὰρξ ἐνώπιόν μου προσκυνῆσαι ἐν Ιερουσαλημ, εἶπεν κύριος. 

## Epistle [Heb 12:4-29 ESV; sermon text]

[4] In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. [5] And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?

> “My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,  
> nor be weary when reproved by him.  
> [6] For the Lord disciplines the one he loves,  
> and chastises every son whom he receives.”
	
[7] It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? [8] If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. [9] Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? [10] For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. [11] For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.

[12] Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, [13] and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. [14] Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. [15] See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; [16] that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. [17] For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.

[18] For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest [19] and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them. [20] For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.” [21] Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.” [22] But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, [23] and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, [24] and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.

[25] See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven. [26] At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.” [27] This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of things that are shaken—that is, things that have been made—in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain. [28] Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, [29] for our God is a consuming fire.

[4] Οὔπω μέχρις αἵματος ἀντικατέστητε πρὸς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἀνταγωνιζόμενοι.
[5] καὶ ἐκλέλησθε τῆς παρακλήσεως, ἥτις ὑμῖν ὡς υἱοῖς διαλέγεται·

> υἱέ μου, μὴ ὀλιγώρει παιδείας κυρίου μηδὲ ἐκλύου ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐλεγχόμενος·  
> [6] ὃν γὰρ ἀγαπᾷ κύριος παιδεύει, μαστιγοῖ δὲ πάντα υἱὸν ὃν παραδέχεται.

[7] εἰς παιδείαν ὑπομένετε, ὡς υἱοῖς ὑμῖν προσφέρεται ὁ θεός. τίς γὰρ υἱὸς ὃν οὐ παιδεύει πατήρ;
[8] εἰ δὲ χωρίς ἐστε παιδείας ἧς μέτοχοι γεγόνασιν πάντες, ἄρα νόθοι καὶ οὐχ υἱοί ἐστε.
9εἶτα τοὺς μὲν τῆς σαρκὸς ἡμῶν πατέρας εἴχομεν παιδευτὰς καὶ ἐνετρεπόμεθα· οὐ πολὺ [δὲ] μᾶλλον ὑποταγησόμεθα τῷ πατρὶ τῶν πνευμάτων καὶ ζήσομεν;
[10] οἱ μὲν γὰρ πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας κατὰ τὸ δοκοῦν αὐτοῖς ἐπαίδευον, ὁ δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον εἰς τὸ μεταλαβεῖν τῆς ἁγιότητος αὐτοῦ.
[11] πᾶσα δὲ παιδεία πρὸς μὲν τὸ παρὸν οὐ δοκεῖ χαρᾶς εἶναι ἀλλὰ λύπης, ὕστερον δὲ καρπὸν εἰρηνικὸν τοῖς δι’ αὐτῆς γεγυμνασμένοις ἀποδίδωσιν δικαιοσύνης.

[12] Διὸ τὰς παρειμένας χεῖρας καὶ τὰ παραλελυμένα γόνατα ἀνορθώσατε,
[13] καὶ τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς ποιεῖτε τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν, ἵνα μὴ τὸ χωλὸν ἐκτραπῇ, ἰαθῇ δὲ μᾶλλον.
[14] Εἰρήνην διώκετε μετὰ πάντων καὶ τὸν ἁγιασμόν, οὗ χωρὶς οὐδεὶς ὄψεται τὸν κύριον,
[15]ἐπισκοποῦντες μή τις ὑστερῶν ἀπὸ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ θεοῦ,
μή τις ῥίζα πικρίας ἄνω φύουσα
ἐνοχλῇ καὶ δι’ αὐτῆς μιανθῶσιν πολλοί,
[16] μή τις πόρνος ἢ βέβηλος ὡς Ἠσαῦ, ὃς ἀντὶ βρώσεως μιᾶς ἀπέδετο τὰ πρωτοτόκια ἑαυτοῦ.
[17] ἴστε γὰρ ὅτι καὶ μετέπειτα θέλων κληρονομῆσαι τὴν εὐλογίαν ἀπεδοκιμάσθη, μετανοίας γὰρ τόπον οὐχ εὗρεν καίπερ μετὰ δακρύων ἐκζητήσας αὐτήν.

[18] Οὐ γὰρ προσεληλύθατε ψηλαφωμένῳ καὶ κεκαυμένῳ πυρὶ καὶ γνόφῳ καὶ ζόφῳ καὶ θυέλλῃ
[19] καὶ σάλπιγγος ἤχῳ καὶ φωνῇ ῥημάτων, ἧς οἱ ἀκούσαντες παρῃτήσαντο μὴ προστεθῆναι αὐτοῖς λόγον,
[20] οὐκ ἔφερον γὰρ τὸ διαστελλόμενον· κἂν θηρίον θίγῃ τοῦ ὄρους, λιθοβοληθήσεται·
[21] καί, οὕτως φοβερὸν ἦν τὸ φανταζόμενον, Μωϋσῆς εἶπεν·
ἔκφοβός εἰμι* καὶ ἔντρομος.
[22] ἀλλὰ προσεληλύθατε Σιὼν ὄρει καὶ πόλει θεοῦ ζῶντος, Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐπουρανίῳ, καὶ μυριάσιν ἀγγέλων, πανηγύρει
[23] καὶ ἐκκλησίᾳ πρωτοτόκων ἀπογεγραμμένων ἐν οὐρανοῖς καὶ κριτῇ θεῷ πάντων καὶ πνεύμασιν δικαίων τετελειωμένων
[24] καὶ διαθήκης νέας μεσίτῃ Ἰησοῦ καὶ αἵματι ῥαντισμοῦ κρεῖττον λαλοῦντι παρὰ τὸν Ἅβελ.

[25] Βλέπετε μὴ παραιτήσησθε τὸν λαλοῦντα· εἰ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι οὐκ ἐξέφυγον ἐπὶ γῆς παραιτησάμενοι τὸν χρηματίζοντα, πολὺ μᾶλλον ἡμεῖς οἱ τὸν ἀπ’ οὐρανῶν ἀποστρεφόμενοι,
[26] οὗ ἡ φωνὴ τὴν γῆν ἐσάλευσεν τότε, νῦν δὲ ἐπήγγελται λέγων·
ἔτι ἅπαξ ἐγὼ
σείσω οὐ μόνον
τὴν γῆν ἀλλὰ
καὶ τὸν οὐρανόν.
[27] τὸ δὲ
ἔτι ἅπαξ* δηλοῖ [τὴν] τῶν σαλευομένων μετάθεσιν ὡς πεποιημένων, ἵνα μείνῃ τὰ μὴ σαλευόμενα.
[28] Διὸ βασιλείαν ἀσάλευτον παραλαμβάνοντες ἔχωμεν χάριν, δι’ ἧς λατρεύωμεν εὐαρέστως τῷ θεῷ μετὰ εὐλαβείας καὶ δέους·
[29] καὶ γὰρ
ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν
πῦρ καταναλίσκον.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 13:22-30 ESV]

[22] He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. [23] And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, [24] “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. [25] When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ then he will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’ [26] Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’ [27] But he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!’ [28] In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. [29] And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. [30] And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we live by faith, and not by sight.
We believe what God has said&mdash;and in particular what God has promised.
Even if circumstances contradict what God has said, we stick with what God has said.
Now here's a tough one: Look at a cute, cuddly baby boy and tell me, &ldquo;He is a sinner.&rdquo;
Look at an adorable baby girl wearing a Onesie and tell me, &ldquo;She\'s is infected with sin.&rdquo;
Though they are cute and adorable, _God says they are sinners_, and I believe Him.

For it is written in Psalm 51: **"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me"** [(Ps&nbsp;51:5 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm%2051%3A5/).
And let us go all the way back to Cain and Abel.
For their parents, Adam and Eve, had just fallen into sin for having believed Satan's lie more than what God had said.
Sin changed everything.
Sin changed not only Adam and Eve personally, but it changed who their children would be.
Imagine the misery&mdash;as I have invited you to do before&mdash;imagine the misery of having been perfect and then falling into sin.
It is like having been Usain Bolt one day and a quadriplegic the next, only worse.
For sin goes deep down into you and ruins everything&mdash;you cannot even listen to God anymore and believe He is telling you the truth.

In misery because of her sin, Eve hoped she was giving birth to the promised Savior who would save her and Adam from sin.
When Eve gave birth to Cain, she said, **&ldquo;I have gotten a man, the LORD&rdquo;** (Gn&nbsp;4:1).
Eve had hoped she was the mother of God&mdash;for only God could save her and Adam from sin, and God had promised a Savior when He said,
**&ldquo;I will put enmity between you[, Satan,] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel&rdquo;** [(Gn&nbsp;3:15 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%203%3A15/).
Eve had hoped that her seed, Cain, would bruise Satan's head and put an end to sin.

But she gave birth to Cain, the first murderer, instead.
And then she gave birth to Abel, who was a hunter. Cain grew food from the ground.
There are parents today who have diseases and addictions that they pass on to their children, but none is worse than sin.
Adam and Eve gave _sin_ to their sons, and it sure showed in Cain.
Cain was jealous of Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over his, and that was enough for Cain to _murder_ his brother Abel out of jealousy.
Our Epistle reading today in Hebrews, chapter&nbsp;12 says that the blood of Jesus speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
Well, I believe the blood of Abel called for revenge because Abel was a sinner just like Cain.

AMEN.

## Notes

There are two main mountains in the Bible: Sinai and Zion, Law and Gospel.

Is 66:19. Cf Is 19:19‑20. Here there is a sign for the worship of the LORD that is located in Egypt, somewhere other than Jerusalem. (In the OT, worship is located strictly in Jerusalem.) This sign is there to save the Egyptians.

Is 66:21. Cf Is 61:6. Is 61 starts with **“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,	because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,	and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn.”**
