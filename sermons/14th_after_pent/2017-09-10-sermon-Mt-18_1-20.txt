## Old Testament [Ezk 33:7‑9 ESV]

[7] "So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. [8] If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. [9] But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul."

## Epistle [Rm 13:1‑10 ESV]

[1] Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. [2] Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. [3] For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, [4] for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. [5] Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. [6] For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. [7] Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.

[8] Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 18:1‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[1] At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” [2] And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them [3] and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. [4] Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

[5] “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, [6] but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.

[7] “Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes! [8] And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. [9] And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.

[10] “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. [12] What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? [13] And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. [14] So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.

[15] “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. [16] But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. [17] If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. [18] Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. [19] Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. [20] For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.”

[1] Ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ προσῆλθον οἱ μαθηταὶ τῷ Ἰησοῦ λέγοντες, Τίς ἄρα μείζων ἐστὶν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν; 
[2] καὶ προσκαλεσάμενος παιδίον ἔστησεν αὐτὸ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν 
[3] καὶ εἶπεν, Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, ἐὰν μὴ στραφῆτε καὶ γένησθε ὡς τὰ παιδία, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν. 
[4] ὅστις οὖν ταπεινώσει ἑαυτὸν ὡς τὸ παιδίον τοῦτο, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ μείζων ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν. 

[5] καὶ ὃς ἐὰν δέξηται ἓν παιδίον τοιοῦτο ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, ἐμὲ δέχεται. 
[6] Ὃς δ' ἂν σκανδαλίσῃ ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων τῶν πιστευόντων εἰς ἐμέ, συμφέρει αὐτῷ ἵνα κρεμασθῇ μύλος ὀνικὸς περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ καταποντισθῇ ἐν τῷ πελάγει τῆς θαλάσσης. 

[7] οὐαὶ τῷ κόσμῳ ἀπὸ τῶν σκανδάλων: ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἐλθεῖν τὰ σκάνδαλα, πλὴν οὐαὶ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ δι' οὗ τὸ σκάνδαλον ἔρχεται. 
[8] Εἰ δὲ ἡ χείρ σου ἢ ὁ πούς σου σκανδαλίζει σε, ἔκκοψον αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ: καλόν σοί ἐστιν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν κυλλὸν ἢ χωλόν, ἢ δύο χεῖρας ἢ δύο πόδας ἔχοντα βληθῆναι εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον. 
[9] καὶ εἰ ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζει σε, ἔξελε αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ: καλόν σοί ἐστιν μονόφθαλμον εἰς τὴν ζωὴν εἰσελθεῖν, ἢ δύο ὀφθαλμοὺς ἔχοντα βληθῆναι εἰς τὴν γέενναν τοῦ πυρός. 

[10] Ὁρᾶτε μὴ καταφρονήσητε ἑνὸς τῶν μικρῶν τούτων: λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι οἱ ἄγγελοι αὐτῶν ἐν οὐρανοῖς διὰ παντὸς βλέπουσι τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πατρός μου τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς. 
[11] Τί 
[12] ὑμῖν δοκεῖ; ἐὰν γένηταί τινι ἀνθρώπῳ ἑκατὸν πρόβατα καὶ πλανηθῇ ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν, οὐχὶ ἀφήσει τὰ ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη καὶ πορευθεὶς ζητεῖ τὸ πλανώμενον; 
[13] καὶ ἐὰν γένηται εὑρεῖν αὐτό, ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι χαίρει ἐπ' αὐτῷ μᾶλλον ἢ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα τοῖς μὴ πεπλανημένοις. 
[14] οὕτως οὐκ ἔστιν θέλημα ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς ἵνα ἀπόληται ἓν τῶν μικρῶν τούτων. 

[15] Ἐὰν δὲ ἁμαρτήσῃ [εἰς σὲ] ὁ ἀδελφός σου, ὕπαγε ἔλεγξον αὐτὸν μεταξὺ σοῦ καὶ αὐτοῦ μόνου. ἐάν σου ἀκούσῃ, ἐκέρδησας τὸν ἀδελφόν σου: 
[16] ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἀκούσῃ, παράλαβε μετὰ σοῦ ἔτι ἕνα ἢ δύο, ἵνα ἐπὶ στόματος δύο μαρτύρων ἢ τριῶν σταθῇ πᾶν ῥῆμα: 
[17] ἐὰν δὲ παρακούσῃ αὐτῶν, εἰπὲ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ: ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τῆς ἐκκλησίας παρακούσῃ, ἔστω σοι ὥσπερ ὁ ἐθνικὸς καὶ ὁ τελώνης. 
[18] Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅσα ἐὰν δήσητε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἔσται δεδεμένα ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ὅσα ἐὰν λύσητε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἔσται λελυμένα ἐν οὐρανῷ. 
[19] Πάλιν [ἀμὴν] λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐὰν δύο συμφωνήσωσιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς περὶ παντὸς πράγματος οὗ ἐὰν αἰτήσωνται, γενήσεται αὐτοῖς παρὰ τοῦ πατρός μου τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς. 
[20] οὗ γάρ εἰσιν δύο ἢ τρεῖς συνηγμένοι εἰς τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα, ἐκεῖ εἰμι ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, no one likes favoritism unless he is the favorite.
And God does reveal to us in Romans, chapter 2 that He does not play favorites---at least not between Jew and Gentile:

> **There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. _For God shows no partiality._** [(Rm 2:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+2/)

For God shows no favoritism. But God *does* have favorites. His favorites are those who have faith---His favorites are those who believe---those who trust Him with all their heart. *We should fear, love, and trust in God above all things.*
That makes us God's favorite.

> **[Abraham] believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.** [(Gn 15:6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+15/)

God *is* partial toward those who trust Him:

> **Simon answered, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! _But at your word_ I will let down the nets.” And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.** [(Lk 5:5‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+5/)

Though God does not show partiality toward races and nationalities, He does show partiality to those people who trust Him---who cling to His Word.
And there are *no greater trusters of God than children* and those who believe like children.
Do you want to be God's favorite? Believe like a child.
Our Holy Gospel today tells us who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

> **At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them and said, "Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the _greatest_ in the kingdom of heaven."**

There. Children are Jesus' favorites, and anyone who humbles himself like a child.
I need not explain to you what a child is---you once were a child or maybe you still are---but may we *all* have the trust of a child toward God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
In short, who is more trusting than a child? And *that*, beloved in the Lord, is the essence of our faith---to trust God above all things and in particular that Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away our sin, and that we ourselves are now His baptized little lambs in His pasture and He is our Good Shepherd.

But beware, you do not want to harm Jesus' favorites.

> **"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, but _whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin_, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."**

If you should harm one of Jesus' favorites, He *will* beat you up.
And it is at this point---when many parade their sin like Sodom and expect God to approve of it---that you better know what sin is and you best be careful not to sin yourself ... but what you really *do not* want to do is to cause a child or a child-like believer to sin.
*That* is the worst.
*Setting an example for children* is serious business.
*How parents act in front of their children* is one of the most holy callings in all of Christendom.
*Setting an example for fellow Christians* is serious business.
*How I, especially as your pastor, act in front of you* is one of the most holy callings in all of Christendom.
Whoever causes one of the little ones who believe in Jesus to sin, it would be better **to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea**, and *that* is agony.

Hell is agony.
Sinning is bad enough, but, God forbid, if it becomes your habit:

> **If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.**

If sin is your habit, you are **better off entering life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire**.
Let me share with you an illustration.
*[Illustration]* Have you ever interrupted someone who was trying to get his work done?
Have you ever ruined work that someone else had worked very hard to accomplish?
That person was angry with you.
What is the work Jesus came to do and continues to do through His Spirit?

> **Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.** [(1Jn 3:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+3/)

Jesus came to destroy sin, the great work of the devil among mankind.
The destruction of the devil's work is proclaimed not only by word, but by the deed of Christ's Crucifixion and Resurrection.
The devil is defeated by Jesus Christ!
(Is there any other Savior from the devil?)
He has ascended into heaven and poured out His Holy Spirit to continue His never-ending work of cleansing our hearts from sin.
I you or I or anyone should ruin his work---to actually *cause* someone to sin---then I have become his enemy and will be destroyed.
If there is something to repent of, do it quickly before you show up on Christ's enemy list.

In view of Christ's and the Holy Spirit's work among us, let the hallmark of our piety to *not* be the one who would cause one of Jesus' little ones to sin.
He has redeemed us and given us His Spirit so that we, too, would hate sin as He does, thanks be to God.

What are we to do? Take sin seriously.
But what if we sin? Confess your sin immediately and return to your Baptism where your sin is drowned.
But what if we sin against each other?
That, beloved in the Lord, is explained to us at the end of the Holy Gospel.
The most difficult thing about Christ is that *He changes everything* and He *is* Lord---His Word stands.
If I would sin against you, you would expect an apology from me.
You would hope that Jesus would even say that that the next thing that has to happen for the relationship to be restored is that I owe you an apology.
Though I may owe you an apology, that is *not* what is to happen according to God't will.
Check the Holy Gospel for yourself: what does our Savior teach us to do if a fellow Christian sins against us?

> **If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.**

If we are to believe like children we are to believe Christ's Word over our own opinion and we are to believe Christ's Word *over our own hurt*.
If you are sitting, expecting an apology from a fellow Christian, *have you first gone to him in a spirit of gentleness and told him his fault?*
If you have not, according to the Holy Gospel, you have not listened to your Lord.
Trust in His Word above all opinions and all hurt. He will not fail you.
Believe in Him like a child and you are His favorite.
AMEN.

## Notes

Mt 17:24‑27. Jesus and Peter pay their temple with a shekel from a fish's mouth.

Holy Gospel. *To cause to sin* is the Greek verb *scandalize*.

Mt 18:20. Tr 67b‑68: "In the same way, in a case of necessity even a layman absolves and becomes the minister and pastor of another.
Augustine tells the story of two Christians in a ship, one of whom baptized the catechumen, who after Baptism then absolved the baptizer.
Here belong the statements of Christ that testify that the Keys have been given to the Church, and not merely to certain persons, **"Where two or three are gathered in My name ..."**

Sermon hymn. The tune for the *Jesus Sinners Doth Receive* is child-like.
