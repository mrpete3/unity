## Announcements

* Gateway worked hard all week and crew from Chillicothe worked hard the last 2 days. Amazing work. Thank you to those who came in to unlock the doors for them. Especially to Laura who has pretty much been here round the clock making sure they have all they need and answering any questions they have.
* Next Sunday, September 2nd will be their first Sunday. They will hold their worship service in the upstairs classroom. But they will join us around 11:30/11:45 for a coffee hour (so we will end Bible Study and Sunday School a little early next Sunday). This will be a nice chance to meet each other and fellowship. Please make every effort to join us next week.
Please tell Joan today if there is something you could bring so there is enough food for our guests.
* Trina has an important announcement after church

## Old Testament [Is 29:11‑19 ESV]

[11] And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” [12] And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot read.”

> [13] And the Lord said:\
> “Because this people draw near with their mouth\
> and honor me with their lips,\
> while their hearts are far from me,\
> and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,\
> [14] therefore, behold, I will again\
> do wonderful things with this people,\
> with wonder upon wonder;\
> and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,\
> and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden.”

> [15] Ah, you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel,\
> whose deeds are in the dark,\
> and who say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”\
> [16] You turn things upside down!\
> Shall the potter be regarded as the clay,\
> that the thing made should say of its maker,\
> “He did not make me”;\
> or the thing formed say of him who formed it,\
> “He has no understanding”?

> [17] Is it not yet a very little while\
> until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field,\
> and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?\
> [18] In that day the deaf shall hear\
> the words of a book,\
> and out of their gloom and darkness\
> the eyes of the blind shall see.\
> [19] The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD,\
> and the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.

## Epistle [Eph 5:22‑33 ESV; sermon text]

[22] Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. [23] For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. [24] Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.

[25] Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, [26] that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, [27] so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.
[28] In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. [29] For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, [30] because we are members of his body. [31] “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” [32] This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. [33] However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.

[22] Αἱ γυναῖκες τοῖς ἰδίοις ἀνδράσιν ὡς τῷ κυρίῳ, 
[23] ὅτι ἀνήρ ἐστιν κεφαλὴ τῆς γυναικὸς ὡς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς κεφαλὴ τῆς ἐκκλησίας, αὐτὸς σωτὴρ τοῦ σώματος. 
[24] ἀλλὰ ὡς ἡ ἐκκλησία ὑποτάσσεται τῷ Χριστῷ, οὕτως καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες τοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἐν παντί. 

[25] Οἱ ἄνδρες, ἀγαπᾶτε τὰς γυναῖκας, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς ἠγάπησεν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν καὶ ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς, 
[26] ἵνα αὐτὴν ἁγιάσῃ καθαρίσας τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος ἐν ῥήματι, 
[27] ἵνα παραστήσῃ αὐτὸς ἑαυτῷ ἔνδοξον τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, μὴ ἔχουσαν σπίλον ἢ ῥυτίδα ἤ τι τῶν τοιούτων, ἀλλ' ἵνα ᾖ ἁγία καὶ ἄμωμος. 
[28] οὕτως ὀφείλουσιν [καὶ] οἱ ἄνδρες ἀγαπᾶν τὰς ἑαυτῶν γυναῖκας ὡς τὰ ἑαυτῶν σώματα. ὁ ἀγαπῶν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα ἑαυτὸν ἀγαπᾷ, 
[29] οὐδεὶς γάρ ποτε τὴν ἑαυτοῦ σάρκα ἐμίσησεν, ἀλλὰ ἐκτρέφει καὶ θάλπει αὐτήν, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, 
[30] ὅτι μέλη ἐσμὲν τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ. 
[31] ἀντὶ τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος [τὸν] πατέρα καὶ [τὴν] μητέρα καὶ προσκολληθήσεται πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν. 
[32] τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο μέγα ἐστίν, ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω εἰς Χριστὸν καὶ εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν. 
[33] πλὴν καὶ ὑμεῖς οἱ καθ' ἕνα ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα οὕτως ἀγαπάτω ὡς ἑαυτόν, ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἵνα φοβῆται τὸν ἄνδρα.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 7:1‑13 ESV]

[1] Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, [2] they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. [3] (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, holding to the tradition of the elders, [4] and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.) [5] And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?” [6] And he said to them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,

> “‘This people honors me with their lips,\
> but their heart is far from me;\
> [7] in vain do they worship me,\
> teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’

[8] You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.”

[9] And he said to them, “You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition! [10] For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.’ [11] But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban”’ (that is, given to God)—[12] then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, [13] thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.”

## Introit [Ps 26:1-2, 6-7; antiphon: Ps 26:8]

> O LORD, I love the habitation | of your house\*\
> and the place where your | glory dwells.\
> Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my in- | tregrity,\*\
> and I have trusted in the LORD without | wavering.\
> Prove me, O LORD, and | try me;\*\
> test my heart | and my mind.\
> I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, | O LORD,\*\
> proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your | wondrous deeds.\

## Collect

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
We have no wedding in the church today, but our sermon hymn is a wedding hymn nonetheless---a prayer for God to bless the marriage of the newlyweds.
Weddings usually not done during the Sunday service, but I want you to know that it is entirely normal to do so, just like we have Baptisms in church on Sundays.
Joining a man and his wife to become one flesh is an act of God ([Gn 2:24](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2:24/)) just like Baptism, and one in which the congregation participates and rejoices.

Though our Epistle reading today teaches us about marriage, it also teaches the core of what we believe and practice about Baptism.

> **Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, _having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word_, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.**

At the core of marriage is a husband who loves his wife **as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself up for her**.
And where do we see Christ loving His Bride, His Church?
**"Having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word"**---Jesus loves us when He baptizes us---**"washing of water with the word."**
If it were just washing with water, your outside would be cleaner and Jesus would have given you a bath.
However,_Baptism is not just plain water, but it is the water included in God's command and **combined with God's word**.
*Water and Word*---*Water and Word* is emphasized in the Small Catechism because *without God's Word the water is plain water and no Baptism.
But with the Word of God it is a Baptism, that is a life-giving water, rich in grace, and a washing of the new birth in the Holy Spirit.*

The first Word of God combined with Baptism is Christ's command:

> _Christ our Lord says in the last chapter of Matthew:_ **"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."** ([Mt 28:19](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+28:19/))

Baptism is like prayer because God has commanded it.
We keep the Second Commandment when we pray because we are honoring God's name by praying in His name, and we pray without ceasing.
In the same way, Jesus has given the command baptize and teach all nations, so we baptize and teach all the time just like we pray.
If Christ has commanded us, we will be busy doing it all the time.

But along with the command to baptize Christ promises that Baptism with faith saves us.

> **"Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."** ([Mk 16:16](https://www.esv.org/Mark+16:16/))

This is a great promise for all sinners to believe: **"Whoever believes and is baptized _will be saved_."**
If Christ says it---if Christ baptizes you---*trust in your Baptism to save you*.
You have no reason to doubt what Christ says and does.
He baptized you---there, He saved you.
Believe it, and you are in fact saved.
Disbelieve it and you will be condemned.

Doubt and disbelief of Christ's Word is the *worst thing we can do*.
We need go no further than the Israelites in the wilderness to see why.

> **All were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.** ([1Co 10:2](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10:2/) ESV)

They were baptized into Moses when the LORD opened the Red Sea and the Israelites crossed on dry ground.
God's mighty right hand was in full display to show that *He saves those who are His*.
Pharaoh's army was in pursuit---I imagine the greatest army on earth in that day.
What could the Israelites do with their backs against the water and Pharaoh's army closing in on them to slaughter them?
Moses, as you know, lifted up his staff and stretched out his hand and the LORD divided the Red Sea in two for the Israelites to cross safely over on dry ground.
The angel of the LORD was behind them as a pillar of cloud and fire to keep the Egyptian army back until *every single Israelite* was safe on the other side---not one was lost to the army.
But the whole army was drowned in the Red Sea.

What good would it have done if any Israelited on that day did not believe Christ's Word---did not believe Christ's power to save---and ran back to Pharaoh's army that day?
Doubt and disbelief of Christ's Word is the *worst thing we can do*.

The Israelites were *baptized into Moses*.
You and I, however, are *baptized into Christ*.
He was born of the virgin Mary to redeem us from our sin, and He did so just as the prophet Isaiah prophesied, **"He was pierced for our transgressions; He was crushed for our iniquities"** ([Is 53:3‑5](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53:3/)).
His suffering and death on the Cross was in our place---He bore the full brunt of our sins and now we do not have to!
He got us out of a greater trouble than Moses did for the Israelites.

Having died for our sins but raised from the dead to demostrate His victory over death,
He makes is victory *our personal victory* when He baptizes us:

> **We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.** ([Rm 6:4](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6:4/))

St. Paul in the Epistle lesson today proclaims Jesus baptizing us to be a loving act of Christ, the Bridegroom, loving us, His Bride.

> **Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, _having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word_, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.**

It is Christ loving His Church. "But now, husbands," says St. Paul, "you do the same thing":
**"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."**

> *For holy Thou indeed dost prove*\
> *The marriage vow to be,*\
> *Proclaiming it a type of love*\
> *Between the Church and Thee.*

Ladies, where will you find a husband who loves you as Christ loves the Church?
Only where there are men who know who Jesus is and what He did for His beloved Church.
Otherwise you will find men who will treat you otherwise.
Be careful of what to expect out of your husband.
And ladies, you are not expected to love your husbands as Christ loved the Church---that is his job.
Listen to husband instead.

When Christ returns, what will He say about what we made of marriage?

> "Lord, I looked at other women."

> "But who am I and what did I say?"

> "Lord, I was sassy to my husband."

> "But who am I and what did I say?"

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
