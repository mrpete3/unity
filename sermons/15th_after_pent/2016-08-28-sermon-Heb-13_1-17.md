## Old Testament [Pr 25:2-10 ESV]

> [2] It is the glory of God to conceal things,  
> but the glory of kings is to search things out.  
> [3] As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,  
> so the heart of kings is unsearchable.  
> [4] Take away the dross from the silver,  
> and the smith has material for a vessel;  
> [5] take away the wicked from the presence of the king,  
> and his throne will be established in righteousness.  
> [6] Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence  
> or stand in the place of the great,  
> [7] for it is better to be told, “Come up here,”  
> than to be put lower in the presence of a noble.
	
> What your eyes have seen  
> [8] do not hastily bring into court,  
> for what will you do in the end,  
> when your neighbor puts you to shame?  
> [9] Argue your case with your neighbor himself,  
> and do not reveal another's secret,  
> [10] lest he who hears you bring shame upon you,  
> and your ill repute have no end.

## Epistle [Heb 13:1-17 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Let brotherly love continue. [2] Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. [3] Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body. [4] Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous. [5] Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” [6] So we can confidently say,

> “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear;  
> what can man do to me?”
	
[7] Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith. [8] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. [9] Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited those devoted to them. [10] We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat. [11] For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp. [12] So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood. [13] Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured. [14] For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come. [15] Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. [16] Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.

[17] Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 14:1-14 ESV]

[1] One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully. [2] And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. [3] And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?” [4] But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away. [5] And he said to them, “Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?” [6] And they could not reply to these things.

[7] Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, [8] “When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him, [9] and he who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give your place to this person,’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. [10] But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. [11] For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”

[12] He said also to the man who had invited him, “When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. [13] But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, [14] and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”

[1] Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκόν τινος τῶν ἀρχόντων [τῶν] Φαρισαίων σαββάτῳ φαγεῖν ἄρτον καὶ αὐτοὶ ἦσαν παρατηρούμενοι αὐτόν.
[2] Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνθρωπός τις ἦν ὑδρωπικὸς ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ.
[3] καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν πρὸς τοὺς νομικοὺς καὶ Φαρισαίους λέγων· ἔξεστιν τῷ σαββάτῳ θεραπεῦσαι ἢ οὔ;
[4] οἱ δὲ ἡσύχασαν. καὶ ἐπιλαβόμενος ἰάσατο αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπέλυσεν.
[5] καὶ πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἶπεν· τίνος ὑμῶν υἱὸς ἢ βοῦς εἰς φρέαρ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὐκ εὐθέως ἀνασπάσει αὐτὸν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ σαββάτου;
[6] καὶ οὐκ ἴσχυσαν ἀνταποκριθῆναι πρὸς ταῦτα.

[7] Ἔλεγεν δὲ πρὸς τοὺς κεκλημένους παραβολήν, ἐπέχων πῶς τὰς πρωτοκλισίας ἐξελέγοντο, λέγων πρὸς αὐτούς·
[8] ὅταν κληθῇς ὑπό τινος εἰς γάμους, μὴ κατακλιθῇς εἰς τὴν πρωτοκλισίαν, μήποτε ἐντιμότερός σου ᾖ κεκλημένος ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ,
[9] καὶ ἐλθὼν ὁ σὲ καὶ αὐτὸν καλέσας ἐρεῖ σοι· δὸς τούτῳ τόπον, καὶ τότε ἄρξῃ μετὰ αἰσχύνης τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον κατέχειν.
[10] ἀλλ’ ὅταν κληθῇς, πορευθεὶς ἀνάπεσε εἰς τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον, ἵνα ὅταν ἔλθῃ ὁ κεκληκώς σε ἐρεῖ σοι· φίλε, προσανάβηθι ἀνώτερον· τότε ἔσται σοι δόξα ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν συνανακειμένων σοι.
[11] ὅτι πᾶς ὁ ὑψῶν ἑαυτὸν ταπεινωθήσεται, καὶ ὁ ταπεινῶν ἑαυτὸν ὑψωθήσεται.

[12] Ἔλεγεν δὲ καὶ τῷ κεκληκότι αὐτόν· ὅταν ποιῇς ἄριστον ἢ δεῖπνον, μὴ φώνει τοὺς φίλους σου μηδὲ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου μηδὲ τοὺς συγγενεῖς σου μηδὲ γείτονας πλουσίους, μήποτε καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀντικαλέσωσίν σε καὶ γένηται ἀνταπόδομά σοι.
[13] ἀλλ’ ὅταν δοχὴν ποιῇς, κάλει πτωχούς, ἀναπείρους, χωλούς, τυφλούς·
[14] καὶ μακάριος ἔσῃ, ὅτι οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἀνταποδοῦναί σοι, ἀνταποδοθήσεται γάρ σοι ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει τῶν δικαίων.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, a priority is what you keep at the top of your list.
For example, it is a priority to tell your children you love them;
it is somewhere down the list to tell your cats you love them.
Our Epistle reading today from Hebrews, chapter&nbsp;13 presents Christian priorities:

> **Let brotherly love continue.**

That is a Christian priority: **Let brotherly love continue.**
There is one word, _love_, in English, but there are many words for _love_ in Greek&mdash;this one being _φιλαδελφία_.
Did you hear that right? Yes, you did: _φιλαδελφία_ is Greek for _brotherly_ love, the kind of love that brothers have for each other.
(And now you know why Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is called &ldquo;the city of brotherly love&rdquo;&mdash;its very name means _brotherly love_.)
St&nbsp;Paul puts it this way:

> **Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor.** [(Rm&nbsp;12:10 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%2012%3A10/)

Brotherly love does not wait to show honor to a brother or sister in Christ, but _outdoes_ the other in showing him honor.
That is a picture of brotherly love in action.

Our next Christian priority is:

> **Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.**

Beloved in the Lord, this is the verse by which some of us say, &ldquo;I have never seen and angel, but then again, maybe I have.&rdquo;
And there it is&mdash;a Chritian priority to show hospitality to strangers; it reflects what our Lord Himself says in the Holy Gospel:

> **&ldquo;When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid.  But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind**&mdash;_the stranger_, you might add&mdash;**and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.&rdquo;** [(Lk&nbsp;14:12&#x2011;14)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2014%3A12-14/)

Who knows? You may be blessed by feeding an angel.

Our next Christian priority is to remember those in prison:

> **Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.**

Yes, most people in prison deserve to be there.
And all people in hell deserve to be there.
And who are you?
Why have compassion on prisoners?
They get what they deserve.
But, beloved in the Lord, this is a good time to remind ourselves what do _our_ sins deserve?
Our sins deserve death row; our sins deserve hell.
From Romans, chapter&nbsp;6:

> **For the wages of sin is death.** [(Rm&nbsp;6:23a)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%206%3A23/)

And from Revelation, chapter&nbsp;20:

> **Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.** [(Rv&nbsp;20:14&#x2011;15 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Revelation%2020%3A14-15/)

Did we write our names in the book of life by anything we did?
Did we save ourselves from the jaws of hell?
Oh no&mdash;_Jesus_ saved us from the jaws of hell, and without Him, that is where we would be!
Are we better than the people sitting in prison?
We may have done better recently.
But with regard to _guilt before God_, we are no better than those who sit in prison.
_[Point to stained glass window]_ Jesus be praised that He removed our guilt from us by His punishment on the Cross in our place!
Let us praise Him by showing compassion to those who are in prison.

Our next Christian priority is marrige:

> **Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.**

I have said it before, and I will say it again:
Marriage is the life-long physical union of a man to his wife; marriage is not a consensual arrangement between a man and anyone he wants; marriage instituted by God.
The marriage bed is for one husband and one wife, and it is theirs alone; everything else is sexual immorality, and **God _will_ judge the sexually immoral and adulterous**.
The sexually immoral and adulterous have broken the Sixth Commandment: **You shall not commit adultery** &hellip;
Marriage was instituted in the Garden of Eden and is a picture of Christ and His Church that continues all the way to the book of Revelation.

Our next Christian priority is not loving money:

> **Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, &ldquo;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&rdquo;**

If there were ever an idol in the United States of America, it is money.
If you love money, you are an idolater and have broken the First Commandment: **You shall have not other gods** &hellip;

And now that on which all our hope rests.
We can confidently say,

> **&ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not fear;**  
> **what can man do to me?&rdquo;**

Jesus is our Helper who snatched us from the jaws of hell.
What trouble is there that He will _not_ get us out of? None.
In any of our Christian priorities, this is foremost in our minds:

> **&ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not fear;**  
> **what can man do to me?&rdquo;** Nothing.

Let us finish with the next Christian priority and then we will call it a day.
Armed with our Christian priorities, may He bless our Voters' Assembly!

> **Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.**

This verse is inscribed on a famous tombstone in the Lutheran Cemetery next door.
Friedrich Conrad Dietrich Wyneken.

> It was not love for adventure nor love for the Saviour or the scattered Germans in
America that moved him.
Rather, as he later said, &ldquo;I went contrary to my will and after great conflicts, from a sense of duty, driven in, and by, my conscience.&rdquo;

There is another pastor buried next door with this verse on his tombstone:

> **&ldquo;Lord, what wilt Thou have me do?&rdquo;** (Acts 9:6)

Rev&nbsp;R. Gerhard Long.
May this be our overarching Christian priority: **&ldquo;Lord, what wilt Thou have me do?&rdquo;** AMEN.

## Notes

Heb 13:7. This verse is on Friedrich Conrad Dietrich Wyneken's gravestone.

The verse on Pastor Long's tombstone is: **“Lord, what wilt Thou have me do?”** (Acts 9:6)

KJV:

> **And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.**

ESV:

> **But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.**

### F.C.D. Wyneken<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">§</a>]</sup>

At Halle, Wyneken became a student of Friedrich Tholuck (1799‑1877), a leading representative of the German Awakening in the nineteenth century.
The Awakening was characterized by an interest in missions, and that led to Wyneken leaving Europe and coming to the United States.
Wyneken had read from missions reports that there was a great need in America for pastors to gather scattered German immigrants into congregations [20].

It was not love for adventure nor love for the Saviour or the scattered Germans in
America that moved him.
Rather, as he later said, “I went contrary to my will and after great conflicts, from a sense of duty, driven in, and by, my conscience” [20‑21].

As a missionary at first, Wyneken would work with Reformed and Moravians to reach the scattered Germans around Fort Wayne, but he grew to the opinion that synods were needed for these people which were organized to exercise discipline in doctrine and life [24].

> Still in America before visiting Germany, it is interesting to note that in 1841 Wyneken did not feel that they needed to be Lutheran.
“As a confessional basis the Augsburg Confession or, where the people are Reformed, a Reformed
confession should serve,” he had written [25].

In order to raise interest in sending missionaries, Wyneken would describe Methodist camp meetings, including an invitation to come to the mourners' bench, as having influence on German Lutherans [25].
Pastors were needed who could protect the people from Methodist influence.

> On his return to Germany in 1841 various people recognized that
Wyneken had become more of a confessional Lutheran [26].

In 1844, Wyneken was not comfortable with the ecumenical stance and weak adherence to Lutheran doctrine and practice by the Synod of the West, which was part of the General Synod.
A member of his own congregation in Fort Wayne brought a complaint against him before the synod, and Wyneken defended himself, speaking both in German and in English, on the basis of the Word of God and the Lutheran Confessions.
In doing so, he questioned the doctrine of the General Synod and asked them to please publicize their doctrine and send it to Germany to those who were supporting missionaries in America.
The General Synod refused to do so, and Wyneken and his congregation in Fort Wayne withdrew from the General Synod [27].

Wyneken now wanted _Lutheran_ training for missionary pastors, and by 1844, he started training two young men in his own parsonage in Fort Wayne.
In 1846, Concordia Theological Seminary was founded in Fort Wayne.

Walther's position on church and ministry was that ordination is not a divine appointment but is an apostolic churchly arrangement which is a public and solemn confirmation of the call [37].
Both Walther and Wyneken shared this position, and especially after the incident with Martin Stephan.

Wyneken served as the second President of The Lutheran Church‒Missouri Synod (1850‑1864).
The synod experienced phenomenal growth at this time [39].

In June 1864, Wyneken received a call to serve as pastor at Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in Cleveland, Ohio.
With that, he left not only his congregation in St Louis, but also the presidency of the synod.
He served here until 1875.
Because of ill health, he moved to California and died in 1876.
He is buried next door in the Lutheran Cemetery.
