## Old Testament [Gn 50:15‑21 ESV]

[15] When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.” [16] So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: [17] ‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. [18] His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” [19] But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of God? [20] As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. [21] So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.

## Epistle [Rm 14:1‑12 ESV]

[1] As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. [2] One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. [3] Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. [4] Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.

[5] One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. [6] The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. [7] For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. [8] For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. [9] For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.

[10] Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; [11] for it is written,

> “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,\
> and every tongue shall confess to God.”
	
	
[12] So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 18:21‑35 ESV; sermon text]

[21] Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?” [22] Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.

[23] “Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. [24] When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. [25] And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. [26] So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ [27] And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. [28] But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’ [29] So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ [30] He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt. [31] When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place. [32] Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. [33] And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’ [34] And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. [35] So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”

[21] Τότε προσελθὼν ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Κύριε, ποσάκις ἁμαρτήσει εἰς ἐμὲ ὁ ἀδελφός μου καὶ ἀφήσω αὐτῷ; ἕως ἑπτάκις; 
[22] λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Οὐ λέγω σοι ἕως ἑπτάκις ἀλλὰ ἕως ἑβδομηκοντάκις ἑπτά. 

[23] Διὰ τοῦτο ὡμοιώθη ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ βασιλεῖ ὃς ἠθέλησεν συνᾶραι λόγον μετὰ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ. 
[24] ἀρξαμένου δὲ αὐτοῦ συναίρειν προσηνέχθη αὐτῷ εἷς ὀφειλέτης μυρίων ταλάντων. 
[25] μὴ ἔχοντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἀποδοῦναι ἐκέλευσεν αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος πραθῆναι καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἔχει, καὶ ἀποδοθῆναι. 
[26] πεσὼν οὖν ὁ δοῦλος προσεκύνει αὐτῷ λέγων, Μακροθύμησον ἐπ' ἐμοί, καὶ πάντα ἀποδώσω σοι. 
[27] σπλαγχνισθεὶς δὲ ὁ κύριος τοῦ δούλου ἐκείνου ἀπέλυσεν αὐτόν, καὶ τὸ δάνειον ἀφῆκεν αὐτῷ. 
[28] ἐξελθὼν δὲ ὁ δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος εὗρεν ἕνα τῶν συνδούλων αὐτοῦ ὃς ὤφειλεν αὐτῷ ἑκατὸν δηνάρια, καὶ κρατήσας αὐτὸν ἔπνιγεν λέγων, Ἀπόδος εἴ τι ὀφείλεις. 
[29] πεσὼν οὖν ὁ σύνδουλος αὐτοῦ παρεκάλει αὐτὸν λέγων, Μακροθύμησον ἐπ' ἐμοί, καὶ ἀποδώσω σοι. 
[30] ὁ δὲ οὐκ ἤθελεν, ἀλλὰ ἀπελθὼν ἔβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς φυλακὴν ἕως ἀποδῷ τὸ ὀφειλόμενον. 
[31] ἰδόντες οὖν οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτοῦ τὰ γενόμενα ἐλυπήθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ ἐλθόντες διεσάφησαν τῷ κυρίῳ ἑαυτῶν πάντα τὰ γενόμενα. 
[32] τότε προσκαλεσάμενος αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ λέγει αὐτῷ, Δοῦλε πονηρέ, πᾶσαν τὴν ὀφειλὴν ἐκείνην ἀφῆκά σοι, ἐπεὶ παρεκάλεσάς με: 
[33] οὐκ ἔδει καὶ σὲ ἐλεῆσαι τὸν σύνδουλόν σου, ὡς κἀγὼ σὲ ἠλέησα; 
[34] καὶ ὀργισθεὶς ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν τοῖς βασανισταῖς ἕως οὗ ἀποδῷ πᾶν τὸ ὀφειλόμενον. 
[35] Οὕτως καὶ ὁ πατήρ μου ὁ οὐράνιος ποιήσει ὑμῖν ἐὰν μὴ ἀφῆτε ἕκαστος τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν καρδιῶν ὑμῶν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.[^1]
What a glorious thing it is to be forgiven by the blood of Jesus shed for our sins---to be truly forgiven before God---truly forgiven before the throne of heaven---truly innocent of all sin before the judgment seat of Christ by faith in His blood---by faith alone.
As wonderful as it is and as wonderful it is to have the Holy Spirit to assure us that all this is true, our lives are constantly mired in trouble.
For we continue to sin while we live in our flesh instead of the Spirit and others continue to sin against us, for they, too, continue to live in their flesh and not in the Spirit.
Thank God that He takes great pains to hide our sins from everyone else and that everyone else's sins are largely hidden from us or we would be in even greater misery than we already are.

[^1]: 2Tm 1:2

What a mess it is to still have to deal with sin.
Jesus, of course, knew that when He gave us the Lord's Prayer:

> **And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.**

When He teaches us the Lord's Prayer in Matthew, chapter 6, He adds this:
**"For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses"** [(Mt 6:14‑15 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6/).
That is right: if you do not forgive, you are not forgiven yourself.
Our Lord teaches this same point to us today in the Holy Gospel:

> **"Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made."**

Yes, it was legal in Bible days to be sold into slavery to pay your debt.
A talent is the amount of money a worker gets paid for *20 years* of work.[^2]
So, it would take him *200,000* years to work off this debt if all his pay went to paying off the debt and he kept no money for himself---*200,000* years---longer than earth has existed.
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who had a servant who owed him 200,000 years' worth of wages, and that is a *big* debt.

[^2]: ESV footnote for Mt 18:25.

> **So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, "Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything." And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.**

The king could have come up with a payment plan, but He chose not to---He has pity on his servant and forgives the whole debt and now the servant has a *zero balance* in his account. What a relief!
*[Illustration]* The obvious illustration here is debt relief.
Have you ever had a debt? Have you ever had a *crushing* debt that you could not deal with?
Have you ever had a *crushing* debt that changed your lifestyle?
"I won't go out to see a movie tonight because if I do, I won't have money to pay my rent."
Again, in the ancient Near East, it was legal for you to be *enslaved* over a crushing debt.
Talk about a change in lifestyle---your freedom to do what you want is completely taken away and you become the property of your master, who can tell you what to do as he pleases until you have worked off your debt.
A crushing debt is one that is too big to pay and that dictates your lifestyle.
For young people who are thinking about taking out student loans for college, beware!
You may accumulate a crushing debt by the time you graduate from college.
You may dream of doing a lot of cool things when you graduate, but if you have a crushing debt from student loans, you may find that what you will really do when you graduate is *not* travel, *not* get married and raise a family, and *not* go out and have fun with your friends because of the crushing debt of your student loans.

The servant has a crushing debt and the master forgives him *everything*.
"You have to pay me back *nothing*. Have a nice day."
What would your response be to being forgiven a crushing debt?
*"Thank you! Thank you very much!"*
Your lifestyle has been given back to you where you do not have to think and direct your actions every day to pay back that debt.
You can do other things now---much happier things!
Go ahead and go out with your friends, get married and raise a family, take a trip to a place you have always wanted to visit.
Your debt is zero; you have the money.

Who, then, is the master in this parable?
Who is the servant?
And what is the debt?
The debt is what you owe your Father in heaven because of your sin.
Remember all those sins that your Father takes great pains to hide from everyone else ... and the ones that got out and others know about?
You owe Him for that.
You owe Him your *life*, for **the wages of sin is _death_** (Rm 6:23a).

> **"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it _you shall surely die_."** [(Gn 2:17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2/)

> **"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."** [(Mt 10:28 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+10/)

What you owe your Father in heaven is described in our parable as a crushing debt that you cannot dream to pay.
If you believe your debt is not that great, Jesus is the judge of that.
Nowhere in the Scriptures does He say that some have not incurred a crushing debt.
On the contrary,

> **For we have already charged that _all_, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written:**\
> **"None is righteous, no, _not one_; _no one_ understands; _no one_ seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; _no one_ does good, _not even one_."** [(Rm 3:9‑12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3/)

When you cry out to your Father in heaven, **"Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything,"** He announces to you through the mouth of a preacher *[Point to Crucifixion window.]* that Jesus, the Son of God, paid that enormous debt---that debt being the punishment and death incurred by your sin.
Believe that He did it---believe that He paid off *your* debt and your Father answers "You owe me nothing. **Go and sin no more.**"

If you cannot fathom your debt that has been paid by the blood of Jesus,
*[Point to altar.]* if Holy Communion, where you receive that same precious blood on your lips is nothing but an empty ritual, you are in trouble.
For you will find that others have sinned against you and owe you something.

> **But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, "Pay what you owe." So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, "Have patience with me, and I will pay you."**

A denarius, as you will hear as the Holy Gospel next week, as a day's wage.
The servant had been forgiven 200,000 years' worth of debt and now he faces a fellow servant who owes him a hundred days.
You have been forgiven four *billion* and this guy owes you eight *thousand*; that is the biblical proportion.
For having been forgiven four *billion* dollars, if you do not forgive the one who has sinned against you, you are refusing to forgive an eight *thousand* dollar debt.
Beloved in the Lord, *God* says that is not right.

> **He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt. When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place. Then his master summoned him and said to him, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?" And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.**

It is one thing to believe---for the seed of the Gospel to be sown in our hearts and begin to grow.
But it is another thing for the seed to grow and bear more grain.
May the Holy Spirit bless us and all of Christendom with an appreciation of our crushing debt that Jesus paid on the Cross.
May this faith bear much fruit, and especially that we *sincerely forgive and gladly do good to those who sin against us*.
AMEN.
