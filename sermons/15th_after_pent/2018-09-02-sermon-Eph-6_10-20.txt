## Old Testament [Dt 4:1‑2, 6‑9 ESV]

[1] “And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the rules that I am teaching you, and do them, that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. [2] You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.

[6] Keep them and do them, for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ [7] For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us, whenever we call upon him? [8] And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?

[9] "Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your children's children."

## Epistle [Eph 6:10‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[10] Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. [11] Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. [12] For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. [13] Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. [14] Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, [15] and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. [16] In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; [17] and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, [18] praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,
[19] and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, [20] for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.

[10] Τοῦ λοιποῦ ἐνδυναμοῦσθε ἐν κυρίῳ καὶ ἐν τῷ κράτει τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ. 
[11] ἐνδύσασθε τὴν πανοπλίαν τοῦ θεοῦ πρὸς τὸ δύνασθαι ὑμᾶς στῆναι πρὸς τὰς μεθοδείας τοῦ διαβόλου: 
[12] ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἡ πάλη πρὸς αἷμα καὶ σάρκα, ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὰς ἀρχάς, πρὸς τὰς ἐξουσίας, πρὸς τοὺς κοσμοκράτορας τοῦ σκότους τούτου, πρὸς τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις. 
[13] διὰ τοῦτο ἀναλάβετε τὴν πανοπλίαν τοῦ θεοῦ, ἵνα δυνηθῆτε ἀντιστῆναι ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ πονηρᾷ καὶ ἅπαντα κατεργασάμενοι στῆναι. 
[14] στῆτε οὖν περιζωσάμενοι τὴν ὀσφὺν ὑμῶν ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, καὶ ἐνδυσάμενοι τὸν θώρακα τῆς δικαιοσύνης, 
[15] καὶ ὑποδησάμενοι τοὺς πόδας ἐν ἑτοιμασίᾳ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου τῆς εἰρήνης, 
[16] ἐν πᾶσιν ἀναλαβόντες τὸν θυρεὸν τῆς πίστεως, ἐν ᾧ δυνήσεσθε πάντα τὰ βέλη τοῦ πονηροῦ [τὰ] πεπυρωμένα σβέσαι: 
[17] καὶ τὴν περικεφαλαίαν τοῦ σωτηρίου δέξασθε, καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν τοῦ πνεύματος, ὅ ἐστιν ῥῆμα θεοῦ, 
[18] διὰ πάσης προσευχῆς καὶ δεήσεως προσευχόμενοι ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ ἐν πνεύματι, καὶ εἰς αὐτὸ ἀγρυπνοῦντες ἐν πάσῃ προσκαρτερήσει καὶ δεήσει περὶ πάντων τῶν ἁγίων, 
[19] καὶ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ, ἵνα μοι δοθῇ λόγος ἐν ἀνοίξει τοῦ στόματός μου, ἐν παρρησίᾳ γνωρίσαι τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ εὐαγγελίου 
[20] ὑπὲρ οὗ πρεσβεύω ἐν ἁλύσει, ἵνα ἐν αὐτῷ παρρησιάσωμαι ὡς δεῖ με λαλῆσαι.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 7:14‑23 ESV]

[14] And he called the people to him again and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand: [15] There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.” [17] And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. [18] And he said to them, “Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, [19] since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)
[20] And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him. [21] For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, [22] coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. [23] All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”

## Introit [Ps 51:7, 10-12; antiphon: Ps 51:2]

> Wash me thoroughly from my in- | iquity,\*\
> and cleanse me | from my sin!\
> Purge me with hyssop, and I | shall be clean;\*\
> wash me, and I shall be whit- | er than snow.\
> Create in me a clean heart, | O God,\*\
> and renew a right spirit with- | in me.\
> Cast me not away from your | presence,\*\
> and take not your Holy Spirit | from me.\
> Restore to me the joy of your sal- | vation,\*\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
One person expresses his or her opinion and another person expresses a different opinion---it happens all the time.
You speak of things your way and I speak of things my way---this is the arena of ideas---one person's idea against another's.
We all live in this arena and have to deal with it if we are to live together with anybody, whether at home or in public.
It is best to listen to and respect someone else's ideas---not that you have to agree with them---and of all the nations in history, our country, the United States of America, is built to protect each citzen's ideas and his or her freedom to express them.

Now, you see things your way and I see them my way---what will we do?
Your idea might win out over mine.
Or, we may not follow my idea or yours; rather, we may compromise and deliberately follow a direction that is the middle road between your idea and mine.
But if all there is is your idea, my idea, and everybody else's ideas, what is there?
Ideology---ideas, and that is it---there are only ideas the proceed from the heart of man.

However, the Creator of man has sobering news about the heart of man in today's Holy Gospel.

> **And [Jesus] said, “What comes out of a person is what _defiles him_. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and _they defile a person_.”** ([Mk 7:20‑23](https://www.esv.org/Mark+7:20/) ESV)

Christ warns us that our eating of food cannot defile us, but our thoughts---our ideas---can and do defile us.
What is dangerous about our ideas is that they can be, and often are, sinful.
The Bible teaches us that we are inclined to be sinful ([Gn 8:21](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+8:21/); [Rm 3:10‑12](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3:10/)).
And if our thoughts are sinful, they defile us before God.
Our ideas get us in trouble with God---there is not just your opinion against my opinion.
There is *much more* than just your idea and mine: God is involved.
There is God's Word and God's judgment according to His Word.

Thanks be to God that He does not leave us guessing which of our ideas are holy and which ideas He judges to be sinful.
He has graciously tells us by the prophet Moses---in the the revealed Word of the Bible---what is holy and what is sinful.

* You shall have no other gods.
* You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.
* Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.

On a side note, I do not know if there has ever been any place in the world where man thought up and tried out a six-day week with one day of rest, or an eight-day week with two days of rest.
Even among those who disregard God's Word, they still order their weeks according to God Word---a week is still seven days---an reminder of the power of God's Word among man's ideas.

Continuing with what is holy and what is sinful:

* Honor your father and your mother.
* You shall not murder.
* You shall not commit adultery.
* You shall not steal.
* You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
* You shall not covet your neighbor's house.
* You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.

The life of mankind is more than ideology---it is not just your idea against mine.
*God is involved with us and He has something to say.*
Furthermore, your own ideas can defile you before God and make Him angry.

And in the Bible, the prophets, evangelists, and apostles have even recorded the foretelling and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Word of God Made Flesh ([Jn 1:1‑14](https://www.esv.org/John+1:1/)).
Beloved in the Lord, it is hardly interesting, and even foolish, to consider only man's ideas with out acknowledging Jesus Christ, the Word of God made flesh.

What happens when Jesus is pushed out or must serve the ideas of man?
Study history---or recall your own experiences---and you will find out.
Ideology will lie---like communism asserting that there is no God---in order to somehow build up the number of its followers.
What happens when Jesus is pushed out or must serve the ideas of man?
Powerful ideological leaders rise up to serve the lie---like Hitler teaching that the Aryan people are the master race, when all mankind is created in God's image.
What happens when Jesus is pushed out and must serve the ideas of man?
Ideological leaders gain such power that they kill people in order to mold the masses to the ideology.

Do you see what happens when man's ideas grow on their own apart from Christ?
Death.
Opponents are sought out and put to death for speaking against the ruling ideology.
The powerful leader of the lie leads the people to war, and behold, many more die.
I have never seen war, but I have been told that young men are taken from their promising futures as husbands and fathers and within days of arriving at the front, their guts are spilled out on the battlefield---by the hundreds---by the thousands.
Now women are sent, too, to die.
Behold the fruit of man's ideas growing apart from Christ.

Either you recognize that throwing Jesus out is a fatal mistake or you are pushing man's ideology.
Behold the lying and the killing and you may be convinced that the devil is real.
How could things be that bad? Because the devil is involved.
Listen, if only for a moment, to Jesus tell us about the devil:

> **[The devil] was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.** ([Jn 8:44b](https://www.esv.org/John+8:44/) ESV)

Read in the Bible how the devil deceived Eve and defiled Adam.
**"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil"** ([Gn 3:5](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:5/) ESV).
The idea that defiled Adam and Eve was Satan's idea that God cannot be trusted that He holds back good from man.
It is Satan's idea, not man's idea, to push Jesus out.
Thus Adam and Eve were defiled and ate the forbidden fruit.
That defilement of sin spread to their children and through their children to us, and here we are---slaves to Satan, not free to implement our own ideas.

Listen, if only for a moment, to the apostle John tell us why Jesus came:

> **Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was _to destroy the works of the devil_.** ([1Jn 3:8](https://www.esv.org/1+John+3:8/) ESV)

*[Point to Crucifixion window]* Behold Christ on the Cross, afflicted by Satan and dying.
Yet He dies as a man---He dies as one of us in Satan's bloody hands.
And Satan cannot win.
*[Point to Resurrection window]* Behold Christ risen from the dead and tell me, who won?
Did Satan win or did Christ win?
Christ won as one of us!
Christ won as our leader and Lord!
He is to be trusted over Satan.
Look to Jesus as the Israelites looked to the bronze serpent on the pole and believe that you are forgiven your wickedness and that you live with Jesus ([Jn
3:15‑16](https://www.esv.org/John+3:15/)).


What is true about the arena of ideas is that God, not just man, speaks in the arena of ideas.
What is true about the arena of ideas is that Satan also speaks lies in the arena of ideas and wants nothing more than to push Christ---to push truth, to push life out of the arena.
Against Satan Christ's voice is to be trusted---that is what He hopes and expects from us---that is how He wants to be worshiped---that we *listen to Him* ([1Sm 15:22](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+15:22/)).
When we do not, we confess that our ideas are quickly mired in wickedness and that we are slaves of Satan.


> **Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.**

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
