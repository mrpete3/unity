## Old Testament [Dt 30:15-20 ESV]

[15] “See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil. [16] If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you today, by loving the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it. [17] But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them, [18] I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess. [19] I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live, [20] loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him, for he is your life and length of days, that you may dwell in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.”

[15] ᾿Ιδοὺ δέδωκα πρὸ προσώπου σου σήμερον τὴν ζωήν καὶ τὸν θάνατον, τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ κακόν. [16] ἐὰν εἰσακούσῃς τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, ἃς ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, ἀγαπᾶν Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, πορεύεσθαι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ φυλάσσεσθαι τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς κρίσεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ζήσεσθε, καὶ πολλοὶ ἔσεσθε, καὶ εὐλογήσει σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, εἰς ἣν εἰσπορεύῃ ἐκεῖ κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν. [17] καὶ ἐὰν μεταστῇ ἡ καρδία σου καὶ μὴ εἰσακούσῃς καὶ πλανηθεὶς προσκυνήσῃς θεοῖς ἑτέροις καὶ λατρεύσῃς αὐτοῖς, [18] ἀναγγέλλω σοι σήμερον ὅτι ἀπωλείᾳ ἀπολεῖσθε καὶ οὐ μὴ πολυήμεροι γένησθε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἰς ἣν ὑμεῖς διαβαίνετε τὸν ᾿Ιορδάνην ἐκεῖ κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν. [19] διαμαρτύρομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον τόν τε οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, τὴν ζωὴν καὶ τὸν θάνατον δέδωκα πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, τὴν εὐλογίαν καὶ τὴν κατάραν· ἔκλεξαι τὴν ζωὴν σύ, ἵνα ζήσῃς σὺ καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου, [20] ἀγαπᾶν Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, εἰσακούειν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔχεσθαι αὐτοῦ· ὅτι τοῦτο ἡ ζωή σου καὶ ἡ μακρότης τῶν ἡμερῶν σου, κατοικεῖν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσι σου ῾Αβραὰμ καὶ ᾿Ισαὰκ καὶ ᾿Ιακὼβ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς.

## Epistle [Phm 1-21 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,

To Philemon our beloved fellow worker [2] and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:

[3] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

[4] I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, [5] because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, [6] and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. [7] For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.

[8] Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, [9] yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus—[10] I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. [11] (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) [12] I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. [13] I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, [14] but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. [15] For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, [16] no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

[17] So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. [18] If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. [19] I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. [20] Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.

[21] Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.

[1] Παῦλος δέσμιος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ Τιμόθεος ὁ ἀδελφὸς

Φιλήμονι τῷ ἀγαπητῷ καὶ συνεργῷ ἡμῶν [2] καὶ Ἀπφίᾳ τῇ ἀδελφῇ καὶ Ἀρχίππῳ τῷ συστρατιώτῃ ἡμῶν καὶ τῇ κατ’ οἶκόν σου ἐκκλησίᾳ,

[3] χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.

[4] Εὐχαριστῶ τῷ θεῷ μου πάντοτε μνείαν σου ποιούμενος ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν μου,
[5] ἀκούων σου τὴν ἀγάπην καὶ τὴν πίστιν, ἣν ἔχεις πρὸς τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν καὶ εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους,
[6] ὅπως ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου ἐνεργὴς γένηται ἐν ἐπιγνώσει παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ τοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν εἰς Χριστόν.
[7] χαρὰν γὰρ πολλὴν ἔσχον καὶ παράκλησιν ἐπὶ τῇ ἀγάπῃ σου, ὅτι τὰ σπλάγχνα τῶν ἁγίων ἀναπέπαυται διὰ σοῦ, ἀδελφέ.

[8] Διὸ πολλὴν ἐν Χριστῷ παρρησίαν ἔχων ἐπιτάσσειν σοι τὸ ἀνῆκον
[9] διὰ τὴν ἀγάπην μᾶλλον παρακαλῶ, τοιοῦτος ὢν ὡς Παῦλος πρεσβύτης νυνὶ δὲ καὶ δέσμιος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ·
[10] παρακαλῶ σε περὶ τοῦ ἐμοῦ τέκνου, ὃν ἐγέννησα ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς, Ὀνήσιμον,
[11] τόν ποτέ σοι ἄχρηστον νυνὶ δὲ [καὶ] σοὶ καὶ ἐμοὶ εὔχρηστον,
[12] ὃν ἀνέπεμψά σοι, αὐτόν, τοῦτ’ ἔστιν τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα· 
[13] ὃν ἐγὼ ἐβουλόμην πρὸς ἐμαυτὸν κατέχειν, ἵνα ὑπὲρ σοῦ μοι διακονῇ ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς τοῦ εὐαγγελίου,
[14] χωρὶς δὲ τῆς σῆς γνώμης οὐδὲν ἠθέλησα ποιῆσαι, ἵνα μὴ ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην τὸ ἀγαθόν σου ᾖ ἀλλὰ κατὰ ἑκούσιον.
[15] Τάχα γὰρ διὰ τοῦτο ἐχωρίσθη πρὸς ὥραν, ἵνα αἰώνιον αὐτὸν ἀπέχῃς,
[16] οὐκέτι ὡς δοῦλον ἀλλ’ ὑπὲρ δοῦλον, ἀδελφὸν ἀγαπητόν, μάλιστα ἐμοί, πόσῳ δὲ μᾶλλον σοὶ καὶ ἐν σαρκὶ καὶ ἐν κυρίῳ.

[17] εἰ οὖν με ἔχεις κοινωνόν, προσλαβοῦ αὐτὸν ὡς ἐμέ.
[18] εἰ δέ τι ἠδίκησέν σε ἢ ὀφείλει, τοῦτο ἐμοὶ ἐλλόγα.
[19] ἐγὼ Παῦλος ἔγραψα τῇ ἐμῇ χειρί, ἐγὼ ἀποτίσω· ἵνα μὴ λέγω σοι ὅτι καὶ σεαυτόν μοι προσοφείλεις.
[20] ναὶ ἀδελφέ, ἐγώ σου ὀναίμην ἐν κυρίῳ· ἀνάπαυσόν μου τὰ σπλάγχνα ἐν Χριστῷ.

[21] Πεποιθὼς τῇ ὑπακοῇ σου ἔγραψά σοι, εἰδὼς ὅτι καὶ ὑπὲρ ἃ λέγω ποιήσεις.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 14:25-35 ESV]

[25] Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, [26] “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. [27] Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. [28] For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? [29] Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, [30] saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’ [31] Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? [32] And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. [33] So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.

[34] “Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? [35] It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

[25] Συνεπορεύοντο δὲ αὐτῷ ὄχλοι πολλοί, καὶ στραφεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς·
[26] εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρός με καὶ οὐ μισεῖ τὸν πατέρα ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τὰς ἀδελφὰς ἔτι τε καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτοῦ, οὐ δύναται εἶναί μου μαθητής.
[27] ὅστις οὐ βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἔρχεται ὀπίσω μου, οὐ δύναται εἶναί μου μαθητής.
[28] Τίς γὰρ ἐξ ὑμῶν θέλων πύργον οἰκοδομῆσαι οὐχὶ πρῶτον καθίσας ψηφίζει τὴν δαπάνην, εἰ ἔχει εἰς ἀπαρτισμόν;
[29] ἵνα μήποτε θέντος αὐτοῦ θεμέλιον καὶ μὴ ἰσχύοντος ἐκτελέσαι πάντες οἱ θεωροῦντες ἄρξωνται αὐτῷ ἐμπαίζειν
[30] λέγοντες ὅτι οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἤρξατο οἰκοδομεῖν καὶ οὐκ ἴσχυσεν ἐκτελέσαι.
[31] Ἢ τίς βασιλεὺς πορευόμενος ἑτέρῳ βασιλεῖ συμβαλεῖν εἰς πόλεμον οὐχὶ καθίσας πρῶτον βουλεύσεται εἰ δυνατός ἐστιν ἐν δέκα χιλιάσιν ὑπαντῆσαι τῷ μετὰ εἴκοσι χιλιάδων ἐρχομένῳ ἐπ’ αὐτόν;
[32] εἰ δὲ μή γε, ἔτι αὐτοῦ πόρρω ὄντος πρεσβείαν ἀποστείλας ἐρωτᾷ τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην.
[33] οὕτως οὖν πᾶς ἐξ ὑμῶν ὃς οὐκ ἀποτάσσεται πᾶσιν τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ ὑπάρχουσιν οὐ δύναται εἶναί μου μαθητής.

[34] Καλὸν οὖν τὸ ἅλας· ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τὸ ἅλας μωρανθῇ, ἐν τίνι ἀρτυθήσεται;
[35] οὔτε εἰς γῆν οὔτε εἰς κοπρίαν εὔθετόν ἐστιν, ἔξω βάλλουσιν αὐτό. ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν ἀκουέτω.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are _the Gospels_; perhaps the four most famous books of the Bible.
Here are recorded birth, earthly ministry, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, whose name we call upon in every trouble, pray, praise, and give thanks.
The book of Psalms may be the most popular book of the Bible, where we with our own lips _do_ pray, praise, and give thanks to our Lord, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever.
And then there are books like Philemon, our Epistle reading for today.
Philemon is a single chapter, 25 verses; that is it.
Let us turn our attention to Philemon, an important book of the Bible.

Philemon is a slaveowner in Colossae whose slave, Onesimus, has run away.
But Onesimus has found his way to the apostle Paul, Onesimus now serves the apostle Paul, but Paul is now sending Onesimus back to Colossae, back to his master Philemon.
The book of Philemon is the letter that Paul wrote to Philemon concerning the return of his runaway slave, Onesimus.

Slavery in the United States was a terrible institution, but slavery in the Roman Empire was different.
Slaves in the Roman Empire could serve in a variety of positions.
There were slaves that worked in chain gangs, there were slaves that were cooks,
there were slaves that were hairdressers&mdash;and this came as a surprise to me&mdash;there were even slaves that were _obstreticians_, baby doctors!
Some Roman slaves held positions of power and responsibility.

Slaves were most often prisoners of war taken from foreign lands, like Germany and England.
If you were a non-Roman family who owed a debt to a Roman family, you could sell one of your family members as a slave to the Roman family to repay your debt.
(_[Humor]_ Anyone in your family you would sell to pay a debt?)
This is how things worked in the Roman Empire.
Roman free persons sometimes sold themselves into slavery to pay off a debt.
(_[Humor]_ Ever think of doing that to improve your credit rating?)
Roman slaves were usually released at the age of 30.
But while they were slaves, they could earn wages, buy and sell property, enter into contracts, and _even own slaves themselves_.<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">§</a>]</sup>

Well, Onesimus was one of these slaves, maybe a personal servant to Philemon.
The apostle Paul writes to Philemon and opens his letter greeting Philemon as a beloved fellow worker in the kingdom of God along with fellow sister Apphia and fellow soldier Archippus _and the church that meets in Philemon's house_.
Apparently, Philemon's congregation, Unity Lutheran Church of Colossae, did not have its own building, but met in Philemon's house.
Philemon is a committed Christian who offers his house for worship and as a fellow worker in the Gospel is an early leader of the Christian Church.
Yet, as you know, he is a slaveowner.

St Paul wants Philemon to do something and in this letter chooses to put it this way:
**&ldquo;Though I am bold enough in Christ to _command_ you to do what is required, yet for love's sake I prefer to _appeal_ to you.&rdquo;**
And the rest of the letter is Paul's appeal to Philemon to take Onesimus back not as a slave, but as a Christian brother.

So much for the information; now for the preaching.
When Jesus gets involved, he changes everything.
_[Point to the Baptism window]_ On the day of our Lord's Baptism, He was baptized with sinners even though He was not a sinner to publicly show&mdash;and with the approval of the Father and the Holy Spirit&mdash;to publicly show that He was here to be involved with sinners.
Now you tell me&mdash;you have heard Christian preaching for some time&mdash;you tell me:
When Jesus got involved with sinners, did anything change?
&rdquo;When Jesus got involved with sinners, things changed&ldquo;
has got to be the greatest _understatement_ of human history!
For when Jesus got involved with sinners, _hell changed to heaven_!
Sinners&mdash;you and I included&mdash;were going to hell for our sins.

Remember the rich man and Lazarus: the rich man ate sumptuously and Lazarus was begging for food at the rich man's gate.

> **The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he called out, &ldquo;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.&rdquo;** (Lk&nbsp;16:22&#x2011;24 ESV)

One of the torments of hell is unquenchable thirst&mdash;something to think about recalling the hot weather we had in August&mdash;heat but no water.
What sin had the rich man committed for which he went to hell?
Is it a sin to be rich? No.
Is it a sin to love money? Yes.
Remember from last week: **Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you”** (Heb&nbsp;13:5 ESV).
It seems like the rich man so loved his money and spent it on a luxurious lifestyle that kept him from having compassion on the hungry beggar at his gate, who had sores on his body and the dogs were licking them [(Lk&nbsp;16:21)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2016%3A21/)!
When they both died, Lazarus the beggar went to heaven and the rich man went to hell.

Let us stick with compassion.
When Jesus got involved with us, did anything change?
_Heaven yes_!
Through the forgiveness of sins in His name&mdash;_[Point to Crucifixion window]_ by his blood shed for the atonement of our sins&mdash;we are no longer condemned by God to hell, but we are declared innocent and children and heirs of heaven!
The Father has compassion on us and sent His Son to save us.
The Son was baptized with sinners, crucified for sinners, and rose from the dead to declare us forgiven.
The Holy Spirit declares to our hearts that this is true!
_God has had compassion on me, will I have compassion on you?_
And that is what is changed in my relationship with you and anyone.
I might not have had compassion on you before, but I will now, for God has shown great compassion to me.

This, then, is Paul's appeal to Philemon.
&ldquo;You may not have had compassion on your runaway slave Onesimus before, but Jesus has changed that.
Through faith in Christ, enlarge your heart and receive him back not as your slave, but as your brother.&rdquo;

> **I will run in the way of your commandments**  
> **when you enlarge my heart!**

AMEN.
