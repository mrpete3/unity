## Old Testament [Is 55:6‑9 ESV]

> [6] “Seek the LORD while he may be found;\
> call upon him while he is near;\
> [7] let the wicked forsake his way,\
> and the unrighteous man his thoughts;\
> let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him,\
> and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\
> [8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,\
> neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.\
> [9] For as the heavens are higher than the earth,\
> so are my ways higher than your ways\
> and my thoughts than your thoughts.

## Epistle [Php 1:12‑14, 19‑30 ESV]

[12] I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, [13] so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. [14] And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

[19] for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, [20] as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. [21] For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. [22] If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. [23] I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. [24] But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. [25] Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, [26] so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.

[27] Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, [28] and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. [29] For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, [30] engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 20:1‑16 ESV; sermon text]

[1] “For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. [2] After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. [3] And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, [4] and to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.’ [5] So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. [6] And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’ [7] They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’ [8] And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’ [9] And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. [10] Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. [11] And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, [12] saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ [13] But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? [14] Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. [15] Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?’ [16] So the last will be first, and the first last.”

[2] συμφωνήσας δὲ μετὰ τῶν ἐργατῶν ἐκ δηναρίου τὴν ἡμέραν ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν ἀμπελῶνα αὐτοῦ. 
[3] καὶ ἐξελθὼν περὶ τρίτην ὥραν εἶδεν ἄλλους ἑστῶτας ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ἀργούς: 
[4] καὶ ἐκείνοις εἶπεν, Ὑπάγετε καὶ ὑμεῖς εἰς τὸν ἀμπελῶνα, καὶ ὃ ἐὰν ᾖ δίκαιον δώσω ὑμῖν. 
[5] οἱ δὲ ἀπῆλθον. πάλιν [δὲ] ἐξελθὼν περὶ ἕκτην καὶ ἐνάτην ὥραν ἐποίησεν ὡσαύτως. 
[6] περὶ δὲ τὴν ἑνδεκάτην ἐξελθὼν εὗρεν ἄλλους ἑστῶτας, καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς, Τί ὧδε ἑστήκατε ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἀργοί; 
[7] λέγουσιν αὐτῷ, Οτι οὐδεὶς ἡμᾶς ἐμισθώσατο. λέγει αὐτοῖς, Ὑπάγετε καὶ ὑμεῖς εἰς τὸν ἀμπελῶνα. 
[8] ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης λέγει ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος τῷ ἐπιτρόπῳ αὐτοῦ, Κάλεσον τοὺς ἐργάτας καὶ ἀπόδος αὐτοῖς τὸν μισθὸν ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῶν ἐσχάτων ἕως τῶν πρώτων. 
[9] καὶ ἐλθόντες οἱ περὶ τὴν ἑνδεκάτην ὥραν ἔλαβον ἀνὰ δηνάριον. 
[10] καὶ ἐλθόντες οἱ πρῶτοι ἐνόμισαν ὅτι πλεῖον λήμψονται: καὶ ἔλαβον [τὸ] ἀνὰ δηνάριον καὶ αὐτοί. 
[11] λαβόντες δὲ ἐγόγγυζον κατὰ τοῦ οἰκοδεσπότου 
[12] λέγοντες, Οὗτοι οἱ ἔσχατοι μίαν ὥραν ἐποίησαν, καὶ ἴσους ἡμῖν αὐτοὺς ἐποίησας τοῖς βαστάσασι τὸ βάρος τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ τὸν καύσωνα. 
[13] ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς ἑνὶ αὐτῶν εἶπεν, Ἑταῖρε, οὐκ ἀδικῶ σε: οὐχὶ δηναρίου συνεφώνησάς μοι; 
[14] ἆρον τὸ σὸν καὶ ὕπαγε: θέλω δὲ τούτῳ τῷ ἐσχάτῳ δοῦναι ὡς καὶ σοί. 
[15] [ἢ] οὐκ ἔξεστίν μοι ὃ θέλω ποιῆσαι ἐν τοῖς ἐμοῖς; ἢ ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου πονηρός ἐστιν ὅτι ἐγὼ ἀγαθός εἰμι; 
[16] Οὕτως ἔσονται οἱ ἔσχατοι πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ πρῶτοι ἔσχατοι.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. You have heard it before and recently you did heard it in the Holy Gospel three Sundays ago:

> **"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."** [(Mt 16:24‑25 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+16/)

Selfless living for our Lord Jesus is something for not only a few Christians but for *all* Christians.
We are all *called* to live this way---by utter commitment to our Lord Jesus.
As we follow Him, we deny ourselves.
And at some point we get tired---exerting ourselves in new ways---taking our bodies and souls to new limits that we have never tested before.
*[Illustration]* One way this happens, for example, is raising children.
Parents are called by God to raise their children in the discipline and instruction of the Lord [(Eph 6:4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+6/).
Raising your children---taking care of their needs 24/7---raising them as Christians---takes *a lot*.
You cannot raise your children without denying yourself; you cannot raise your children without exerting yourself in new ways.
But what makes it easier is that your children are cute.
Aren't they adorable?

*[Another illustration]* Another way that I see often see Christians denying themselves is being the caregiver not of their child, but perhaps of their parents or a loved one.
We *know* that God is pleased when we honor our parents, and when we care for them, we *know* he is pleased.
But we know from the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Lk 10) that the Samaritan is the one who does good in God's sight and who cares for a victim of a robbery and assault, though the victim is someone he does not even know.
The Lord has called many of you to care for someone else---whether a parent or a loved one or even a stranger---it is your responisiblity to make sure that he or she is okay and is has taken care of.
When the Lord calls you to this position---again---you may have taken up a burden harder to bear than anything you have done before.
At some point you get tired---exerting yourself in new ways---taking your body and soul to a limit that you have never tested before.

In the Holy Gospel today, the master of the house hires laborers to work in his vineyard.
For those who were hired at six in the morning, this is a long day of work in the scorching heat.
In this Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard the workday is *hot*, and those who are first hired agree to a day's wages: a denarius.
These workers will be tested by the exertion of physical labor compounded by the heat; make no mistake about it---they will earn their denarius.
And off to work they go.

The master finds other workers standing around at nine in the morning and he puts them to work, too.
But he does not tell them precisely what their pay will be.
He simply says, **"whatever is right I will give you."**
And off to work they go.

You get the idea from the parable that the master does not like to see unemployed workers.
We have no idea whether he had enough workers for his vineyard after hiring the first two rounds of workers at six and at nine, but we do notice that whenever he sees an idle worker standing around, he gives him a job.

But what if you are called to care for someone who is not cute at all?

And in the end, even if we die, you know that **"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain"** [(Php 1:21 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+1/).

**"These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat."**

Beware of the grumbling of the Israelites in the desert.

> *Tho' dark my path and sad my lot,*\
> *Let my be still and murmur not.*

*We cannot stand before our Father relying on anything we have done.*

> *Tho' Thou hast called me to resign*\
> *What most I prized, it ne'er was mine;*\
> *I have but yielded what was Thine---"Thy will be done."*

> **For my thoughts are not your thoughts,**\
> **neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.** [(Is 55:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+55/)

> **Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?**

> *Renew my will from day to day;*\
> *Blend it with Thine and take away*\
> *All that now makes it hard to say,*\
> *"Thy will be done."*

AMEN.
