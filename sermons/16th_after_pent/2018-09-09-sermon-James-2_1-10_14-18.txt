## During the service

## Announcements

* Thank you for welcoming our family in Christ last Sunday. Going forward we will need to get used to a few things. On Sunday mornings to be respectful of 
the space they are using which is the 2nd floor classroom, the first floor classroom and the restroom on the main floor in the back stairwell.
Also, since their little children have kid's time in our library between 10:30 and 11:45 which is the time that some of us leave the building
after drinking some coffee, please try to be very careful to close the Behrwald door tightly behind you as you leave.

## Old Testament [Is 35:4-7a ESV]

> [4] Say to those who have an anxious heart, “Be strong; fear not! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.”\
> [5] Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;\
> [6] then shall the lame man leap like a deer,and the tongue of the mute sing for joy.\
> For waters break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;\
> [7] the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water.

## Epistle [James 2:1‑10, 14-18 ESV; sermon text]

[1] My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. [2] For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 
[3] and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” 
[4] have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? [5] Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he
has promised to those who love him? [6] But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court? [7] Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?
[8] If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. [9] But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 
[10] For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.

...

[14] What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
[15] If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, [16] and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? [17] So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
[18] But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.

[1] Ἀδελφοί μου, μὴ ἐν προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῆς δόξης. 
[2] ἐὰν γὰρ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς συναγωγὴν ὑμῶν ἀνὴρ χρυσοδακτύλιος ἐν ἐσθῆτι λαμπρᾷ, εἰσέλθῃ δὲ καὶ πτωχὸς ἐν ῥυπαρᾷ ἐσθῆτι, 
[3] ἐπιβλέψητε δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν φοροῦντα τὴν ἐσθῆτα τὴν λαμπρὰν καὶ εἴπητε, Σὺ κάθου ὧδε καλῶς, καὶ τῷ πτωχῷ εἴπητε, Σὺ στῆθι ἐκεῖ ἢ κάθου ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου, 
[4] οὐ διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ ἐγένεσθε κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν; 
[5] Ἀκούσατε, ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί. οὐχ ὁ θεὸς ἐξελέξατο τοὺς πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ πλουσίους ἐν πίστει καὶ κληρονόμους τῆς βασιλείας ἧς ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν; 
[6] ὑμεῖς δὲ ἠτιμάσατε τὸν πτωχόν. οὐχ οἱ πλούσιοι καταδυναστεύουσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια; 
[7] οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασφημοῦσιν τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ' ὑμᾶς; 
[8] εἰ μέντοι νόμον τελεῖτε βασιλικὸν κατὰ τὴν γραφήν, Ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν, καλῶς ποιεῖτε: 
[9] εἰ δὲ προσωπολημπτεῖτε, ἁμαρτίαν ἐργάζεσθε, ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου ὡς παραβάται. 
[10] ὅστις γὰρ ὅλον τὸν νόμον τηρήσῃ, πταίσῃ δὲ ἐν ἑνί, γέγονεν πάντων ἔνοχος. 

...

[14] Τί τὸ ὄφελος, ἀδελφοί μου, ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν, ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ; μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν; 
[15] ἐὰν ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἀδελφὴ γυμνοὶ ὑπάρχωσιν καὶ λειπόμενοι τῆς ἐφημέρου τροφῆς, 
[16] εἴπῃ δέ τις αὐτοῖς ἐξ ὑμῶν, Ὑπάγετε ἐν εἰρήνῃ, θερμαίνεσθε καὶ χορτάζεσθε, μὴ δῶτε δὲ αὐτοῖς τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τοῦ σώματος, τί τὸ ὄφελος; 
[17] οὕτως καὶ ἡ πίστις, ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ ἔργα, νεκρά ἐστιν καθ' ἑαυτήν. 
[18] Ἀλλ' ἐρεῖ τις, Σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις κἀγὼ ἔργα ἔχω. δεῖξόν μοι τὴν πίστιν σου χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων, κἀγώ σοι δείξω ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 7:(24-30)31-37 ESV]

[24] And from there [Jesus] arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. [25] But immediately a woman whose little 
daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. [26] Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
[27] And he said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” [28] But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even 
the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.” [29] And he said to her, “For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.” [30] And she went home and found the child lying
in bed and the demon gone.

[31] Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. [32] And they brought to him a man who was deaf and 
had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him. [33] And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue. 
[34] And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” [35] And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. [36] And Jesus charged them 
to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. [37] And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

> **And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ---by grace you have been saved.** ([Eph 2:1‑5](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2:1/) ESV)

We have been refreshed by our recent Epistle readings from Ephesians, and this passage is from the beginning of Ephesians, chapter 2.
But it is time to move on and today we begin our Epistle readings from James.
The passage that you just heard from Ephesians, though, is the bedrock of our faith---we were children of wrath for the sin in which we lived but nevertheless, our Father in heaven still sought us and loved us by sending us his Son Jesus to save us from our sin.
It is written in Ephesians, chapter 2, and for the joy that wells up from believing that this is true---that we sinners have a merciful Father---we sang the hymn:

> *By grace I'm saved, grace free and boundless;*\
> *My soul believe and doubt it not.*\
> *Whay stagger at this word of promise?*\
> *Hath Scripture ever falsehood taught?*\
> *Nay; then this word must true remain:*\
> *By grace thou, too, shalt heav'n obtain.*

By grace, I, a poor, miserable sinner have been forgiven---by grace---it is a *free gift* that I did not earn---heaven is a free gift given to me by my merciful Father instead of the hell I deserve.
Our Christian joy is this: our status has been changed from children of wrath to children of God *by grace---it is a gift*.
You did not earn the promotion, I did not earn the promotion: God did it.
*[Point to the Crucifixion window]* Jesus did it when He became the child of wrath in our place on the Cross. **Upon him was the chastisement the brought us peace, and with His wounds we are healed** ([Is 53:5b](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53:5/) ESV)! Alleluia!

> **For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.** ([Eph 2:8‑9](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2:8/) ESV)

And those verses also come from Ephesians, chapter 2.
Ephesians, chapter 2 is an excellent summary of our faith,
and I hope it is familiar to all of you.
But if you are not familiar with this summary of the Christian faith, behold the Good News: God has saved you from your sin by the work of His Son Jesus on the Cross.
*[Point to the Crucifixion window]* There He bled and died in punishment for your sin.
He did it for you even though you hated Him and showed it by continually rebelling against Him.
Do you see the thief on the right of Jesus?
He realizes that Jesus is dying for him, and Jesus tells him,
**"Truly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise"** ([Lk 23:43](https://www.esv.org/Luke+23:43/)).
God's breaks though your rebellion against Him and says, "I still love you!"
In other words, *our Father in heaven has shown great mercy on you through giving His Son Jesus to die for your sins*.

Beloved in the Lord, should this move your soul, then you may praise God and say, "Alleluia!"
Should you be filled with joy, then you may want to express it, and we did by singing the hymn.

> *By grace I'm saved, grace free and boundless;*\
> *My soul **believe** and doubt it not.*

Have faith that it is ours, and we have it---we are saved, every one of us, by faith in Christ, and faith alone.

Moving on to our Epistle reading this morning from James, you may think that James strikes a different chord---would you say he even rains on our parade?

> **What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?**

I want you to know that there has historically been conflict between St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians and the epistle of James because *it sounds like James is contradicting Paul*---it sounds like the Bible contradicts itself, which gets everyone interested.
Paul teaches that we are saved by faith alone without works and James teaches that faith *without* works *cannot save us*.
(I am not going to stop now and leave you hanging.)
I suspect that it is for this reason that the lectionary has the Epistle readings from James right after the Epistle readings from Ephesians---to give the preacher a chance to carefully preach both Ephesians and James correctly.
So here I go. Help me, dear Lord Jesus!

Beloved in the Lord, James steps right out in chapter 1 to challenges us:

> **Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, _the law of liberty_, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.** ([Jas 1:22‑25](https://www.esv.org/James+1:22/) ESV)

We do not have screens in our sanctuary, but if we did, I would show you the YouTube video entitled *[Cows looking in a mirror for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0PKuhiI3zA)*.
The cows are confused.
They are curious and just stand there looking at themselves and some then walk away.
A Christian who hears the word and does not do it is like a cow who sees himself in the mirror, stares, and then walks away.
James, however, refers to **the perfect law, the law of liberty**.
When we keep **the law of liberty**, we will not be like the cow who does nothing.
James refers directly to **the law of liberty** not once, but twice; the second time with our Epistle reading in chapter 2:

> **So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under _the law of liberty_. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.** ([Jas 2:12‑13]() ESV)

**Mercy triumphs over judgment**: this is the explanation we have for **the law of liberty**.
**The law of liberty**, I believe, connects directly to Jesus' call for mercy, not sacrifice, and you will begin to see, I hope, that James does not contradict Paul.
For our Lord Jesus Christ tells the Pharisees in Matthew's Gospel,

> **"Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."** ([Mt 9:13](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+9:13/) ESV)

The righteous in the Old Testament brought sacrifices to the temple to keep God's Law.
But what God wants more than sacrifice is *mercy*.
Jesus says this because He has just come to Matthew's house, and Matthew is a *tax collector*, and tax collectors are *sinners*.
The Pharisees complain to the disciples, **“Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”** ([Mt 9:11](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+9:11/) ESV)
*What is Jesus doing with sinners?* the Pharisees complain.

> **But when [Jesus] heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and _learn what this means_: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”** ([Mt 9:12‑13](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+9:12/) ESV)

Here we have, by the way, a command from our Lord to learn something.
We will do well to learn it!

> **"I desire mercy, and not sacrifice."**

Jesus did not come to call the Pharisees, He came to call the tax collectors and prostitutes---He came to show mercy to sinners and unless the Pharisees---who are quite busy thinking that they serve God with their sacrifices---unless the Pharisees receive Christ as sinners in need of God's mercy, they do not have Christ and they are without God's mercy.

**The law of liberty** is known only to a sinner who has received God's mercy shown in Christ Jesus.
**The law of liberty** is to know that you are free from the burden of your sins.
**The law of liberty** rejoices in Jesus lifting the crushing burden of sin and shifting this burden on His back all the way to the Cross.
**The law of liberty** in thankfulness asks, "Whose burden can I now lighten to give glory to my Lord Jesus? I'll do it."

> **"I desire mercy, and not sacrifice."**

> **"I will show you my faith by my works."** 

Where James writes, **"I will show you my faith by my works,"** he teaches us to bear the fruit that Jesus wants: **"I desire mercy, and not sacrifice."**
And it is true: if the fruit is lacking, our faith is dead.

James does not contradict faith that Paul emphasizes: James teaches us to preserve faith and to strengthen faith by showing mercy.
And so,

> **if a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.**

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

## Notes

Ps 103:10. **"He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities."**

Jas 1:25, 2:12‑13. The law of liberty lives in the light of God's mercy given to us in Christ. God's people are to show mercy, not judgment or partiality.

Jas 2:1. **"... _as_ you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ"**---what you do when you believe.

Jas 2:14. Cf. Eph 2:8. They apprear to contradict each other.
