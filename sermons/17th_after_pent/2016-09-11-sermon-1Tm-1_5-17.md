## Old Testament [Ezk 34:11-24 ESV]

[11] “For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out. [12] As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. [13] And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country. [14] I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel. [15] I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD. [16] I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.

[17] “As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats. [18] Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet? [19] And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?

[20] “Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. [21] Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad, [22] I will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep. [23] And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. [24] And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them. I am the LORD; I have spoken.”

[11] διότι τάδε λέγει κύριος ᾿Ιδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκζητήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου καὶ ἐπισκέψομαι αὐτά.
[12] ὥσπερ ζητεῖ ὁ ποιμὴν τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ, ὅταν ᾖ γνόφος καὶ νεφέλη ἐν μέσῳ προβάτων διακεχωρισμένων, οὕτως ἐκζητήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου καὶ ἀπελάσω αὐτὰ ἀπὸ παντὸς τόπου, οὗ διεσπάρησαν ἐκεῖ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ νεφέλης καὶ γνόφου.
[13] καὶ ἐξάξω αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ συνάξω αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν χωρῶν καὶ εἰσάξω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν καὶ βοσκήσω αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Ισραηλ καὶ ἐν ταῖς φάραγξιν καὶ ἐν πάσῃ κατοικίᾳ τῆς γῆς·
[14] ἐν νομῇ ἀγαθῇ βοσκήσω αὐτούς, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ ὑψηλῷ Ισραηλ ἔσονται αἱ μάνδραι αὐτῶν· ἐκεῖ κοιμηθήσονται καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται ἐν τρυφῇ ἀγαθῇ καὶ ἐν νομῇ πίονι βοσκηθήσονται ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων Ισραηλ.
[15] ἐγὼ βοσκήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου καὶ ἐγὼ ἀναπαύσω αὐτά, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι κύριος. τάδε λέγει κύριος κύριος
[16] Τὸ ἀπολωλὸς ζητήσω καὶ τὸ πλανώμενον ἐπιστρέψω καὶ τὸ συντετριμμένον καταδήσω καὶ τὸ ἐκλεῖπον ἐνισχύσω καὶ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν φυλάξω καὶ βοσκήσω αὐτὰ μετὰ κρίματος.

[17] καὶ ὑμεῖς, πρόβατα, τάδε λέγει κύριος κύριος ᾿Ιδοὺ ἐγὼ διακρινῶ ἀνὰ μέσον προβάτου καὶ προβάτου, κριῶν καὶ τράγων·
[18] καὶ οὐχ ἱκανὸν ὑμῖν ὅτι τὴν καλὴν νομὴν ἐνέμεσθε, καὶ τὰ κατάλοιπα τῆς νομῆς ὑμῶν κατεπατεῖτε τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν· καὶ τὸ καθεστηκὸς ὕδωρ ἐπίνετε καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν ἐταράσσετε·
[19] καὶ τὰ πρόβατά μου τὰ πατήματα τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν ἐνέμοντο καὶ τὸ τεταραγμένον ὕδωρ ὑπὸ τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν ἔπινον.

[20] διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει κύριος κύριος ᾿Ιδοὺ ἐγὼ διακρινῶ ἀνὰ μέσον προβάτου ἰσχυροῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον προβάτου ἀσθενοῦς.
[21] ἐπὶ ταῖς πλευραῖς καὶ τοῖς ὤμοις ὑμῶν διωθεῖσθε καὶ τοῖς κέρασιν ὑμῶν ἐκερατίζετε καὶ πᾶν τὸ ἐκλεῖπον ἐξεθλίβετε.
[22] καὶ σώσω τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὦσιν ἔτι εἰς προνομήν, καὶ κρινῶ ἀνὰ μέσον κριοῦ πρὸς κριόν.
[23] καὶ ἀναστήσω ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ποιμένα ἕνα καὶ ποιμανεῖ αὐτούς, τὸν δοῦλόν μου Δαυιδ, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῶν ποιμήν·
[24] καὶ ἐγὼ κύριος ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς θεόν, καὶ Δαυιδ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν ἄρχων· ἐγὼ κύριος ἐλάλησα. 

## Epistle [1Tm 1:5-17 ESV; sermon text]

[5] The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. [6] Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion, [7] desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.

[8] Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, [9] understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, [10] the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, [11] in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.

[12] I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service, [13] though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, [14] and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. [15] The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. [16] But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. [17] To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 15:1-10 ESV]

[1] Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. [2] And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, “This man receives sinners and eats with them.”

[3] So he told them this parable: [4] “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? [5] And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. [6] And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.’ [7] Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.

[8] “Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? [9] And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ [10] Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

## Introit [Ps 30:2-5; antiphon: Ps 30:11a, 12b]

> You have turned for me my mourning into | dancing;*  
> O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you for- | ever!
> O LORD my God, I cried to | you for help,*
> and you have | healed me.
> O LORD, you have brought up my soul | from Sheol;*
> you restored me to life from among those who go down | to the pit.
> Sing praises to the LORD, O | you his saints,*
> and give thanks to his | holy name.
> For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a | lifetime.*
> Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the | morning.


## Collect

Lord Jesus, You are the Good Shepherd, without whom nothing is secure. Rescue and preserve us that we may not be lost forever but follow You, rejoicing in the way that leads to eternal life; for You live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
