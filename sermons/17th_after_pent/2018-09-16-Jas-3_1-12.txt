## Old Testament [Is 50:4-10 ESV]

> [4] The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are taught,\
> that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary.\
> Morning by morning he awakens; he awakens my ear
> to hear as those who are taught.\
>[5] The Lord God has opened my ear,\
> and I was not rebellious;\
> I turned not backward.\
>[6] I gave my back to those who strike,\
> and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard;\
> I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting.\
>[7] But the Lord God helps me;\
> therefore I have not been disgraced;\
> therefore I have set my face like a flint,\
> and I know that I shall not be put to shame.\
> [8] He who vindicates me is near.\
> Who will contend with me?\
> Let us stand up together.\
> Who is my adversary?\
> Let him come near to me.\
>[9] Behold, the Lord God helps me;\
> who will declare me guilty?\
> Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment;\
> the moth will eat them up.\
>[10] Who among you fears the Lord\
> and obeys the voice of his servant?\
> Let him who walks in darkness\
> and has no light\
> trust in the name of the Lord\
> and rely on his God.\

## Epistle [James 3:1-12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
[2] For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.
[3] If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. [4] Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. [5] So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.

How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
[6] And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell.
[7] For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, [8] but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. [9] With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. [10] From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. [11] Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? [12] Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.

[1] Μὴ πολλοὶ διδάσκαλοι γίνεσθε, ἀδελφοί μου, εἰδότες ὅτι μεῖζον κρίμα λημψόμεθα. 
[2] πολλὰ γὰρ πταίομεν ἅπαντες. εἴ τις ἐν λόγῳ οὐ πταίει, οὗτος τέλειος ἀνήρ, δυνατὸς χαλιναγωγῆσαι καὶ ὅλον τὸ σῶμα. 
[3] εἰ δὲ τῶν ἵππων τοὺς χαλινοὺς εἰς τὰ στόματα βάλλομεν εἰς τὸ πείθεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἡμῖν, καὶ ὅλον τὸ σῶμα αὐτῶν μετάγομεν. 
[4] ἰδοὺ καὶ τὰ πλοῖα, τηλικαῦτα ὄντα καὶ ὑπὸ ἀνέμων σκληρῶν ἐλαυνόμενα, μετάγεται ὑπὸ ἐλαχίστου πηδαλίου ὅπου ἡ ὁρμὴ τοῦ εὐθύνοντος βούλεται: 
[5] οὕτως καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα μικρὸν μέλος ἐστὶν καὶ μεγάλα αὐχεῖ.

Ἰδοὺ ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην ἀνάπτει: 
[6] καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα πῦρ, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας, ἡ γλῶσσα καθίσταται ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν, ἡ σπιλοῦσα ὅλον τὸ σῶμα καὶ φλογίζουσα τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως καὶ φλογιζομένη ὑπὸ τῆς γεέννης. 
[7] πᾶσα γὰρ φύσις θηρίων τε καὶ πετεινῶν ἑρπετῶν τε καὶ ἐναλίων δαμάζεται καὶ δεδάμασται τῇ φύσει τῇ ἀνθρωπίνῃ: 
[8] τὴν δὲ γλῶσσαν οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται ἀνθρώπων: ἀκατάστατον κακόν, μεστὴ ἰοῦ θανατηφόρου. 
[9] ἐν αὐτῇ εὐλογοῦμεν τὸν κύριον καὶ πατέρα, καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ καταρώμεθα τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς καθ' ὁμοίωσιν θεοῦ γεγονότας: 
[10] ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ στόματος ἐξέρχεται εὐλογία καὶ κατάρα. οὐ χρή, ἀδελφοί μου, ταῦτα οὕτως γίνεσθαι. 
[11] μήτι ἡ πηγὴ ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς ὀπῆς βρύει τὸ γλυκὺ καὶ τὸ πικρόν; 
[12] μὴ δύναται, ἀδελφοί μου, συκῆ ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι ἢ ἄμπελος σῦκα; οὔτε ἁλυκὸν γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 9:14-29 ESV]

[14] And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. [15] And immediately all the crowd, 
when they saw [Jesus], were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. [16] And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”
[17] And someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. [18] And whenever
it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.” 
[19] And he answered them, “O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.” 
[20] And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, 
foaming at the mouth. [21] And Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood. 
[22] And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 
[23] And Jesus said to him, “‘If you can’! All things are possible for one who believes.” [24] Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, 
“I believe; help my unbelief!” [25] And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, 
“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.” [26] And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, 
it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, “He is dead.” [27] But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. 
[28] And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” [29] And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Who among us is *not* tugged in every which direction?
Which of these tugs should we pay attention to first?
There is urgency and there is also priority.
Which has the highest priority---which should we focus on?
It is hard to figure out, but, thanks be to God, we have guidance from His Word on this matter of what we should make our priority in today's Epistle reading.
For here we have teaching on *the tongue*---yes, that little appendage behind our lips and between our teeth that weighs a few ounces at most.
But that few ounces of muscle controls your *whole body*:

> **If anyone does not stumble in _what he says_, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.**

I invite you then at this moment to consider every word that you have ever articulated---every syllable that has proceeded from your tongue *and acknowledge that they were all heard by our Father in heaven*.
*I* did not hear them all, but it may be fair to say, "Dear Lord, are you in trouble!"
James writes,

> **The tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell.**

We are reminded of Christ's teaching in Matthew, chapter 15:

> **What comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.** ([Mt 15:18‑20](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+15:18/) ESV)

And need I remind you that hell is real?
For all that has proceeded from *my* mouth, I deserve, according to God's Word, to be in that place where the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched ([Mk 9:48](https://www.esv.org/Mark+9:48/)).

How does the Bible speak about King David?

2 Samuel 7:12–13

[12] When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. [13] He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. (ESV)

In 2 Samuel, chapter 11, David commits murder and adultery.
In 2 Samuel, chapter 12, David confesses his sin and the prophet Nathan absolves him, *and David believes it*.
In 2 Samuel, chapter 24, David sinned by counting the people.
Again, David confessed his sin and believed God's forgiveness.

Soon after his death,
1 Kings 2:33

[33] So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the LORD forevermore.” (ESV)

1 Kings 3:14

[14] And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.” (ESV)

1 Kings 8:25

[25] Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’ (ESV)

Thank Jesus for His gracioius words to you and pay attention to the words that come from you tongue.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
