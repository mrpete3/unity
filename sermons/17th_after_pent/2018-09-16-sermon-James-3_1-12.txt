## Old Testament [Is 50:4-10 ESV]

> [4]The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are taught,\
> that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary.\
> Morning by morning he awakens; he awakens my ear
> to hear as those who are taught.\
>[5] The Lord God has opened my ear,\
> and I was not rebellious;\
> I turned not backward.\
>[6] I gave my back to those who strike,\
> and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard;\
> I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting.\
>[7] But the Lord God helps me;\
> therefore I have not been disgraced;\
> therefore I have set my face like a flint,\
> and I know that I shall not be put to shame.\
> [8]He who vindicates me is near.\
> Who will contend with me?\
> Let us stand up together.\
> Who is my adversary?\
> Let him come near to me.\
>[9] Behold, the Lord God helps me;\
> who will declare me guilty?\
> Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment;\
> the moth will eat them up.\
>[10] Who among you fears the Lord\
> and obeys the voice of his servant?\
> Let him who walks in darkness\
> and has no light\
> trust in the name of the Lord\
> and rely on his God.\

## Epistle [James 3:1-12 ESV; sermon text]
[1]Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. [2] For we all stumble in many ways. 
And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body. [3] If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they 
obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. [4] Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small 
rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. [5] So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.
How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! [6] And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining 
the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell. [7] For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed 
and has been tamed by mankind, [8] but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. [9] With it we bless our Lord and Father, 
and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. [10] From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. 
[11] Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? [12] Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 9:14-29 ESV]

[14] And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. [15] And immediately all the crowd, 
when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. [16] And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”
[17] And someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. [18] And whenever
it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.” 
[19] And he answered them, “O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.” 
[20] And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, 
foaming at the mouth. [21] And Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood. 
[22] And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 
[23] And Jesus said to him, “‘If you can’! All things are possible for one who believes.” [24] Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, 
“I believe; help my unbelief!” [25] And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, 
“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.” [26] And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, 
it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, “He is dead.” [27] But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. 
[28] And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” [29] And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.”

## Introit [Ps 31:14-16; antiphon: Ps 31:24]

> I say, "You | are my God."\
> My times are | in your hand;\*\
> rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from my perse- | cutors!\
