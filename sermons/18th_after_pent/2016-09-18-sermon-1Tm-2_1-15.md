## Old Testament [Am 8:4-7 ESV]

> [4] Hear this, you who trample on the needy  
> and bring the poor of the land to an end,  
> [5] saying, “When will the new moon be over,  
> that we may sell grain?  
> And the Sabbath,  
> that we may offer wheat for sale,  
> that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great  
> and deal deceitfully with false balances,  
> [6] that we may buy the poor for silver  
> and the needy for a pair of sandals  
> and sell the chaff of the wheat?”  
> [7] The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:  
> “Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.”

> [4] ᾿Ακούσατε δὴ ταῦτα οἱ ἐκτρίβοντες εἰς τὸ πρωΐ πένητα καὶ καταδυναστεύοντες πτωχοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς,  
> [5] οἱ λέγοντες· πότε διελεύσεται ὁ μὴν καὶ ἐμπολεμήσομεν καὶ τὰ σάββατα καὶ ἀνοίξομεν θησαυρὸν τοῦ ποιῆσαι μέτρον μικρὸν καὶ τοῦ μεγαλῦναι στάθμια καὶ ποιῆσαι ζυγὸν ἄδικον  
> [6] τοῦ κτᾶσθαι ἐν ἀργυρίῳ καὶ πτωχοὺς καὶ πένητα ἀντὶ ὑποδημάτων καὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς γεννήματος ἐμπορευσόμεθα;  
> [7] ὀμνύει Κύριος κατὰ τῆς ὑπερηφανίας ᾿Ιακώβ, εἰ ἐπιλησθήσεται εἰς νῖκος πάντα τὰ ἔργα ὑμῶν.

## Epistle [1Tm 2:1-15 ESV; sermon text]

[1] First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, [2] for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. [3] This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, [4] who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. [5] For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, [6] who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. [7] For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

[8] I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; [9] likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, [10] but with what is proper for women who profess godliness—with good works. [11] Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. [12] I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. [13] For Adam was formed first, then Eve; [14] and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. [15] Yet she will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.

[1] Παρακαλῶ οὖν πρῶτον πάντων ποιεῖσθαι δεήσεις, προσευχάς, ἐντεύξεις, εὐχαριστίας, ὑπὲρ πάντων ἀνθρώπων, [2] ὑπὲρ βασιλέων καὶ πάντων τῶν ἐν ὑπεροχῇ ὄντων, ἵνα ἤρεμον καὶ ἡσύχιον βίον διάγωμεν ἐν πάσῃ εὐσεβείᾳ καὶ σεμνότητι. [3] τοῦτο καλὸν καὶ ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν θεοῦ, [4] ὃς πάντας ἀνθρώπους θέλει σωθῆναι καὶ εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας ἐλθεῖν. [5] εἷς γὰρ θεός, εἷς καὶ μεσίτης θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπων, ἄνθρωπος Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς, [6] ὁ δοὺς ἑαυτὸν ἀντίλυτρον ὑπὲρ πάντων, τὸ μαρτύριον καιροῖς ἰδίοις: [7] εἰς ὃ ἐτέθην ἐγὼ κῆρυξ καὶ ἀπόστολος ἀλήθειαν λέγω, οὐ ψεύδομαι διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ.

[8] Βούλομαι οὖν προσεύχεσθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ, ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας χωρὶς ὀργῆς καὶ διαλογισμοῦ: [9] ὡσαύτως [καὶ] γυναῖκας ἐν καταστολῇ κοσμίῳ μετὰ αἰδοῦς καὶ σωφροσύνης κοσμεῖν ἑαυτάς, μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν καὶ χρυσίῳ ἢ μαργαρίταις ἢ ἱματισμῷ πολυτελεῖ, [10] ἀλλ' ὃ πρέπει γυναιξὶν ἐπαγγελλομέναις θεοσέβειαν, δι' ἔργων ἀγαθῶν. [11] γυνὴ ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ μανθανέτω ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ: [12] διδάσκειν δὲ γυναικὶ οὐκ ἐπιτρέπω, οὐδὲ αὐθεντεῖν ἀνδρός, ἀλλ' εἶναι ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ. [13] Ἀδὰμ γὰρ πρῶτος ἐπλάσθη, εἶτα Εὕα: [14] καὶ Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη, ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν. [15] σωθήσεται δὲ διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας, ἐὰν μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ καὶ ἁγιασμῷ μετὰ σωφροσύνης. 

## Holy Gospel [Lk 16:1-15 ESV]

[1] He also said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions. [2] And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’ [3] And the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. [4] I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’ [5] So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ [6] He said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’ [7] Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ [8] The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. [9] And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.

[10] “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. [11] If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? [12] And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? [13] No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”

[14] The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. [15] And he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

[1] Ἔλεγεν δὲ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς μαθητάς· ἄνθρωπός τις ἦν πλούσιος ὃς εἶχεν οἰκονόμον, καὶ οὗτος διεβλήθη αὐτῷ ὡς διασκορπίζων τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ.
2καὶ φωνήσας αὐτὸν εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί τοῦτο ἀκούω περὶ σοῦ; ἀπόδος τὸν λόγον τῆς οἰκονομίας σου, οὐ γὰρ δύνῃ ἔτι οἰκονομεῖν.
3εἶπεν δὲ ἐν ἑαυτῷ ὁ οἰκονόμος· τί ποιήσω, ὅτι ὁ κύριός μου ἀφαιρεῖται τὴν οἰκονομίαν ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ; σκάπτειν οὐκ ἰσχύω, ἐπαιτεῖν αἰσχύνομαι.
4ἔγνων τί ποιήσω, ἵνα ὅταν μετασταθῶ ἐκ τῆς οἰκονομίας δέξωνταί με εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν.
5καὶ προσκαλεσάμενος ἕνα ἕκαστον τῶν χρεοφειλετῶν τοῦ κυρίου ἑαυτοῦ ἔλεγεν τῷ πρώτῳ· πόσον ὀφείλεις τῷ κυρίῳ μου;
6ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἑκατὸν βάτους ἐλαίου. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· δέξαι σου τὰ γράμματα καὶ καθίσας ταχέως γράψον πεντήκοντα.
7ἔπειτα ἑτέρῳ εἶπεν· σὺ δὲ πόσον ὀφείλεις; ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἑκατὸν κόρους σίτου. λέγει αὐτῷ· δέξαι σου τὰ γράμματα καὶ γράψον ὀγδοήκοντα.
8καὶ ἐπῄνεσεν ὁ κύριος τὸν οἰκονόμον τῆς ἀδικίας ὅτι φρονίμως ἐποίησεν· ὅτι οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου φρονιμώτεροι ὑπὲρ τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ φωτὸς εἰς τὴν γενεὰν τὴν ἑαυτῶν εἰσιν. 
9Καὶ ἐγὼ ὑμῖν λέγω, ἑαυτοῖς ποιήσατε φίλους ἐκ τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας, ἵνα ὅταν ἐκλίπῃ δέξωνται ὑμᾶς εἰς τὰς αἰωνίους σκηνάς.

[10] Ὁ πιστὸς ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ καὶ ἐν πολλῷ πιστός ἐστιν, καὶ ὁ ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ ἄδικος καὶ ἐν πολλῷ ἄδικός ἐστιν.
[11] εἰ οὖν ἐν τῷ ἀδίκῳ μαμωνᾷ πιστοὶ οὐκ ἐγένεσθε, τὸ ἀληθινὸν τίς ὑμῖν πιστεύσει;
[12] καὶ εἰ ἐν τῷ ἀλλοτρίῳ πιστοὶ οὐκ ἐγένεσθε, τὸ ὑμέτερον τίς ὑμῖν δώσει;
[13] Οὐδεὶς οἰκέτης δύναται δυσὶν κυρίοις δουλεύειν· ἢ γὰρ τὸν ἕνα μισήσει καὶ τὸν ἕτερον ἀγαπήσει, ἢ ἑνὸς ἀνθέξεται καὶ τοῦ ἑτέρου καταφρονήσει. οὐ δύνασθε θεῷ δουλεύειν καὶ μαμωνᾷ.

[14] Ἤκουον δὲ ταῦτα πάντα οἱ Φαρισαῖοι φιλάργυροι ὑπάρχοντες καὶ ἐξεμυκτήριζον αὐτόν.
[15] καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ὑμεῖς ἐστε οἱ δικαιοῦντες ἑαυτοὺς ἐνώπιον τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὁ δὲ θεὸς γινώσκει τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν· ὅτι τὸ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ὑψηλὸν βδέλυγμα ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we turn this morning to our Epistle reading from 1&nbsp;Timothy, chapter&nbsp;2: **&ldquo;I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people.&rdquo;**
I urge you to pray; pray for all people‒**for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way**.

This is what we pray for in the 4th Petition of the Lord's Prayer: **that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way**.
Our daily bread includes _everything_ that has to do with the support and needs of the body; such as good government and good weather.
We _need_ good government and good weather, so pray for them.
Think about it&mdash;if God takes away good weather, we are better off staying inside&mdash;it is too dangerous to go out.
In the same way, if God takes away good government, again, we are better off staying inside&mdash;it is too dangerous to go out.
Let us pray.

> _[Pray]_ Thank you, heavenly Father, for good government that it is safe to go out and that we are here today with little to fear.
Bless Councilman Kelley, Mayor Jackson, Police Chief Williams, County Commissioner Budish, Governor Kasich, and President Obama.
Bless our nation, we pray, that we elect good and faithful rulers and a new President of the United States of Your own choosing, through Jesus Christ,
Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.

That was important. Now let us continue with our Epistle reading as our guide.

> **This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.**

Jesus says, **“I am the way, and _the truth_, and the life. _No one_ comes to the Father except through Me”** [(Jn 14:6)](http://www.esvbible.org/John%2014%3A6/).
And you may have noticed that _no one_ is exclusive language: _no one_ comes to the Father except through Jesus.
This is offensive to the lovers of inclusive language, but it is neverthess true: God wants all men to be saved through Jesus and only through Jesus.
Our Father in heaven has so _ordered our lives_ so that it is simple: &ldquo;I sent you one Savior, my beloved Son Jesus.
**For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved**&rdquo; [(Ac 4:12)](http://www.esvbible.org/Acts+4:12/)‒saved from sin, saved from death, saved from Satan, and saved from hell.
If we sinners are to be saved, is has got to be Jesus!

Beloved in the Lord, God did not create sin&mdash;God did not create death.
If God had created them, we would not need to be saved from them.
But the Bible tells us that Satan is a heavenly creature who turned against God ([Jb 1:6](http://www.esvbible.org/Job%201%3A6/), [2Pt 2:4](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Peter%202%3A4/)) and brought sin and death into our lives.
Satan is the ancient serpent who in the beginning of mankind turned Eve against God in the Garden of Eden ([Rv 12:9](http://www.esvbible.org/Revelation+12:9/), [Gn 3](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%203/)).
&ldquo;You can't trust God. Listen to me.&rdquo;
It was God's created order, as you may recall, that man not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
He warned man, &ldquo;Don't eat from this tree. If you do, you'll die.&rdquo;
Adam did not even know what death was&mdash;death is not part of God's creation that Adam lived in.
But, as you know, Satan sold Eve on thinking that there was something better than God's created order.
He convinced Eve to believe that God is holding back something good from you.
&ldquo;Eat that fruit, and see what good God is holding back from you.&rdquo;
Think of that for just a moment.
Eve holds the forbidden fruit and is about to bite into it, thinking something good is going to come out of it, like being as wise as God.
She bites into it and death itself soaks into her body.
Adam does not better and follows suit.
This was how God's perfect, created order was destroyed by our sin, for Adam begat Cain, who was a sinner, and then Adam begat Seth, who the Bible says was created in _Adam's_ image, not anymore in _God's_ image ([Gn 5:3](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%205%3A3/), [Gn 1:27](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%201%3A27/)).
By human procreation, Adam's sin became _our_ sin.

Our sin ruins God's created order.
Jesus, the second person of the Triune God, the Son of God, came to restore God's created order in our sin-infected world.
Our Lord Jesus came to reverse the terrible effects of our sin!
Again, as St Paul writes, our heavenly Father **desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth**&mdash;to be saved by faith in _His Son Jesus_, who came and was born as one of us from the virgin Mary to bear the punishment for our sins, and who was raised from the dead do declare our forgiveness and justification before the judgment seat of God [(Rm 4:25)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+4:25/)!
Alleluia! Thank you, Lord Jesus!
Faith in our Lord Jesus establishes the Church, where God's order, thankfully, has been restored&mdash;the Church against which the gates of hell will not prevail [(Mt&nbsp;16:18)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+16:18/)!

In Christ's Church, the Holy Spirit has been poured out upon us, thankfully, through our Baptism (which we rejoice in today especially for Sam, Demarion, and Nichole) and heavenly order is restored.
This includes marriage.
How many of you are aware that sin can ruin marriage?
What is marriage anyway?
Before Adam and Eve fell into sin, God made marriage in the Garden of Eden, as it is written, **“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh”** [(Gn 2:24 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%202%3A24/).

In Christ's Church, marriage is restored.
In Christ's Church, marriage between a man and His wife parallels the marriage between Christ and _His_ Bride, the Church.
This is the clear teaching of St&nbsp;Paul in Ephesians, chapter&nbsp;5:

> **Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.**

> **Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.** [(Eph&nbsp;5:22&#x2011;27 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Ephesians%205%3A22-27/)

The act of Baptism, which happend to Sam, Demarion, and Nichole today, is an act of Jesus Christ washing His Bride, His Church, to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word.
_[Point to baptismal font]_ This is not just water, beloved in the Lord, this is the Word of God _in and with the water_ that makes it _Baptism_&mdash;a lavish washing away of sins.
&ldquo;I want Christ in my life.&rdquo;
Believe and be baptized and He has marked you as His own dear Church.
He is in your life and you are redeemed from sin, death, devil, and hell.

Now many couples say, &ldquo;We want Christ in our relationship.&rdquo;
Do you believe in Him? Are you baptized? That is where to start.
And these days you have to ask: Are you married? Do you intend to get married?
For the Bible is clear that God made marriage and that He is the one who, in fact, joins a husband and his wife in marriage.

Now if you are a married couple and you say, &ldquo;We want Christ in our marriage,&rdquo;
where is Christ in a marriage?
**“Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.”**
A Christian husband is Christ to His wife&mdash;not her savior from sin, but one who has vowed to take care of her and give himself up for her that she will be holy and without blemish on the day when Christ returns.
Being a Christian husband is a high calling; Christian wives, by the way, are nowhere called to give themselves up for their husbands as Jesus did&mdash;that is the husband's job.
A Christian wife, on the other hand, is to be modest and listen to her husband.
That, beloved in the Lord, is Christ's recreation of marriage&mdash;it is a clear as crystal in the Bible.
Ladies, if you would like to be freed from that yoke, you are on your own.
Some women, frankly, would rather _not_ be a Christian wife, but God has revealed in the Bible the order of marriage recreated by faith in Christ.

An immodest wife&mdash;say, one dressed like an NFL cheerleader&mdash;or lacking self‑control&mdash;say, flirting on Facebook&mdash;is not a Christian wife.
This does _not_ mean that a Christian husband can get away with it and a Christian wife cannot‒He is faithful to her as Christ is to His Church.
And, Christian husbands, as you well know, you do not even _look_ at another woman&mdash;not even the NFL cheerleader you will see on TV this afternoon&mdash;with lustful intent in your heart [(Mt&nbsp;5:28)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+5:28/).
(You are much better off going to the church picnic instead.)
Christ has restored order to marriage that was ruined by sin.

St Paul brings up that **Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor**.
Yet elsewhere in the Bible, _Adam_ is held responsible for the first transgression, not Eve.
The prophet Hosea writes, **“But like _Adam_ they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me”** [(Hos 6:7 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Hosea+6:7/).
And St Paul himself writes in Romans, chapter 5, **“Just as sin came into the world through one _man_, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned”** [(Rm 5:12 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+5:12/).
Though Eve may have sinned first, Adam is responsible for his wife.
So I would also add that in Christ's recreation, it is the husband who is responsible to God for his wife.
Lord, bless your Church we pray, with responsible husbands.

Both husbands, and wives, and unmarried people&mdash;every man, woman, and child&mdash;is saved by the Child born by Mary, who has restored order in His Church that He has redeemed from this dying world. Grant us Your Holy Spirit, Lord, that we continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control. AMEN.
