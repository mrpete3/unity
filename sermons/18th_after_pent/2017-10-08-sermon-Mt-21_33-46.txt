## Old Testament [Is 5:1‑7 ESV]

> [1] Let me sing for my beloved\
> my love song concerning his vineyard:\
> My beloved had a vineyard\
> on a very fertile hill.\
> [2] He dug it and cleared it of stones,\
> and planted it with choice vines;\
> he built a watchtower in the midst of it,\
> and hewed out a wine vat in it;\
> and he looked for it to yield grapes,\
> but it yielded wild grapes.


> [3] And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem\
> and men of Judah,\
> judge between me and my vineyard.\
> [4] What more was there to do for my vineyard,\
> that I have not done in it?\
> When I looked for it to yield grapes,\
> why did it yield wild grapes?


> [5] And now I will tell you\
> what I will do to my vineyard.\
> I will remove its hedge,\
> and it shall be devoured;\
> I will break down its wall,\
> and it shall be trampled down.\
> [6] I will make it a waste;\
> it shall not be pruned or hoed,\
> and briers and thorns shall grow up;\
> I will also command the clouds\
> that they rain no rain upon it.


> [7] For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts\
> is the house of Israel,\
> and the men of Judah\
> are his pleasant planting;\
> and he looked for justice,\
> but behold, bloodshed;\
> for righteousness,\
> but behold, an outcry!

## Epistle [Php 3:4b‑14 ESV]

[4b] If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: [5] circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; [6] as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. [7] But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. [8] Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ [9] and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—[10] that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, [11] that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

[12] Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. [13] Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, [14] I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 21:33‑46 ESV; sermon text]

[33] “Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. [34] When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. [35] And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. [36] Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. [37] Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ [38] But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.’ [39] And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. [40] When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” [41] They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.”

> [42] Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:\
> “‘The stone that the builders rejected\
> has become the cornerstone;\
> this was the Lord's doing,\
> and it is marvelous in our eyes’?	
	
[43] Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. [44] And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.”

[45] When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. [46] And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.
