## Old Testament [Is 5:1‑7 ESV]

> [1] Let me sing for my beloved\
> my love song concerning his vineyard:\
> My beloved had a vineyard\
> on a very fertile hill.\
> [2] He dug it and cleared it of stones,\
> and planted it with choice vines;\
> he built a watchtower in the midst of it,\
> and hewed out a wine vat in it;\
> and he looked for it to yield grapes,\
> but it yielded wild grapes.

> [3] And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem\
> and men of Judah,\
> judge between me and my vineyard.\
> [4] What more was there to do for my vineyard,\
> that I have not done in it?\
> When I looked for it to yield grapes,\
> why did it yield wild grapes?

> [5] And now I will tell you\
> what I will do to my vineyard.\
> I will remove its hedge,\
> and it shall be devoured;\
> I will break down its wall,\
> and it shall be trampled down.\
> [6] I will make it a waste;\
> it shall not be pruned or hoed,\
> and briers and thorns shall grow up;\
> I will also command the clouds\
> that they rain no rain upon it.

> [7] For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts\
> is the house of Israel,\
> and the men of Judah\
> are his pleasant planting;\
> and he looked for justice,\
> but behold, bloodshed;\
> for righteousness,\
> but behold, an outcry!

## Epistle [Php 3:4b‑14 ESV]

[4b] If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: [5] circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; [6] as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. [7] But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. [8] Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ [9] and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—[10] that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, [11] that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

[12] Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. [13] Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, [14] I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 21:33‑46 ESV; sermon text]

[33] “Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. [34] When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. [35] And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. [36] Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. [37] Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ [38] But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.’ [39] And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. [40] When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” [41] They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.”

> [42] Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:\
> “‘The stone that the builders rejected\
> has become the cornerstone;\
> this was the Lord's doing,\
> and it is marvelous in our eyes’?	
	
[43] Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. [44] And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.”

[45] When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. [46] And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.

## Collect

Gracious God, You gave Your Son into the hands of sinful men who killed Him. Forgive us when we reject Your unfailing love, and grant us the fullness of Your salvation; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Olga next door, as you probably know, grows wine grapes, and as far as I can tell, I have not seen any grapes this year
because when there *are* grapes, I can smell them from across the parking lot.
Her husband, Julius, planted those vines, and I have learned from Olga that you do not just let the vines grow and *presto!* you get grapes---you have to trim the vines, you have to care for the soil, the weather has to cooperate, and when everything is just right, *then* you get grapes.

In our Old Testment reading today from Isaiah, chapter 5, the LORD says this concerning the care and cultivation of *His* vineyard:

> **What more was there to do for my vineyard,**\
> **that I have not done in it?**\
> **When I looked for it to yield grapes,**\
> **why did it yield wild grapes? ...**

> **[I] looked for justice,**\
> **but behold, bloodshed;**\
> **for righteousness,**\
> **but behold, an outcry!**

The LORD's vineyard is the house of Israel---the Jewish people.
God looks for justice and righteousness in the house of Israel, but He sees neither righteousness nor justice.
Instead of justice, innocent blood is shed, and instead of righteousness, the people cry out agains their leaders, "That's wrong!"
This is how the house of Israel lives---the LORD has done everything there is to do to have a fruitful vineyard, and instead of yielding *wine* grapes, it yields *wild* grapes.
And, believe me, you do not have to go far to find wild grapes in Cleveland.
Those are the giant vines with grape leaves and a shaggy bark that grow all over the trees and choke them; their fruit is puny grapes and the vines are just giant weeds.
The house of Israel has been cultivated by the LORD to produce wine grapes---to show forth the fruit of justice and righteousness---but there are only the unwanted vines of wild grapes.

The dangerous thing is that the house of Israel thinks that they will get away with it---that the LORD does not see---that they will get away with it because the LORD treats them preferentially.

In our Holy Gospel today, Jesus returns to the house of Israel. He is speaking to the chief priest and elders of the house of Israel, who have confronted Him and challenged His authority (Mt 21:23).
Jesus will not tell them by what authority He teaches---He will not tell them by what authority He casts out Satan---He will not tell them by what authority He heals the sick---because they won't answer a simple question: **"The baptism of John [the Baptist], from where did it come? From heaven or from man?"** 
The leaders of the house of Israel will not answer that question in truth, so they answer in their political interest: **"We do not know"** [(Mt 21:25, 27 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+21/).
That is not a wise answer.

In order to make His point perfectly clear, Jesus tells them this parable:

> **There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit.**

The prophet Isaiah is one of those servants that the LORD sends to the house of Israel to get His fruit.
And like the prophet Isaiah proclaims, there in nothing more the master of the house can do that he has not done for his vineyard to produce wine grapes.
He has even dug a winepress---everything is set up for the tenants to work the vineyard and produce grapes and wine.

But here it goes bad.

> **The tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them.**

The tenants rebel against their master---they plan to claim His vineyard as their own.

> **Finally he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son." But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, "This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance." And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.**

And you know what the master is going to do with these wicked tenants.
The chief priests and the elders of the house of Israel figure it out: Jesus is talking about *them*. They are the tenants and He is the Son.
They cannot and will not accept that Jesus is the Son of God and that He has the Father's authority to ask for fruit from the house of Israel.
"We will kill you and keep the vineyard as our own."
Jesus is rejected. But

> **The stone that the builders rejected**\
> **has become the cornerstone;**\
> **this was the Lord's doing,**\
> **and it is marvelous in our eyes**
	
> **"Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits."**

Jewish rejection of Jesus marks that the kingdom of God has been taken away from them.
But is this a blessing to the Gentiles?
*Yes, it is.*
Our Lord Jesus is born a Jew of the virgin Mary and He comes first to the house of Israel;
as the Bible says, **"The Jew first, but _also_ the Gentiles."**
He comes to the Jews first, but as you hear in the Holy Gospel today, they reject Him.
Jesus comes to the Jewish leaders and looks for fruit according to the prophecy of Isaiah.
But He finds no fruit---He finds no justice---He finds no righteousness.
The chief priests and the elders and the Pharisees say, "Who are you anyway to come looking for fruit from us? By whose authority do you speak?"
At another time, as recorded in John, chapter 8, Jesus argues with them and claims to have lived before Abraham and says, **"Before Abraham was, I AM"** (Jn 8:58).
Not only does Jesus claim to come from God, He claims to *be* God, for I AM is *Yahweh*, God's name.

This is too much for the Jewish leaders and for that they sentence Jesus to die and they apply political pressure to have Pontius Pilate crucify Him.
And it works. Jesus is put to death.

But

> **The stone that the builders rejected**\
> **has become the cornerstone;**\
> **this was the Lord's doing,**\
> **and it is marvelous in our eyes**

Jesus' rejection *shines* before us on Good Friday.

> *When I survey the wondrous cross*\
> *On which the Prince of Glory died,*\
> *My richest gains I count but lost*\
> *And pour contempt on all my pride.*

For the prophet Isaiah also tells the reason for His Cross: **He was crushed for our iniquities** (Is 53:5 ESV).
God the Father *allows* His Son Jesus to be rejected by the Jews, to be crucified under Pontius Pilate not only for the sins of the Jews, but also for the sins of the Gentiles---for every sin of man---that God's anger against His rebellious creatures would be propitiated---God is no longer angry at your sin by the bloody sacrifice of His Son.
This is whom we preach: *Christ cruficied for you*.

His rejection and death means life and acceptance for you by God by the forgiveness of your sins, and let *that* be forevermore marvelous in your eyes.
Beloved in the Lord, you are the new tenants in the kingdom.
Those who have rejected Jesus have been broken off and you have been grafted in.
The Lord is expecting fruit---justice and righteousness among ourselves and mercy shown to our neighbor, not invented sacrifice to God.
Welcome to the vineyard where the wild grapes have been pulled out and everything that can be done for a vineyard to produce wine grapes has been done.
AMEN.
