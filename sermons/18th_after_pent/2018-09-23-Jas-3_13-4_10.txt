## During the service

## Announcements

* Thank you for welcoming our family in Christ last Sunday. Going forward we will need to get used to a few things. On Sunday mornings to be respectful of 
the space they are using which is the 2nd floor classroom, the first floor classroom and the restroom on the main floor in the back stairwell.
Also, since their little children have kid's time in our library between 10:30 and 11:45 which is the time that some of us leave the building
after drinking some coffee, please try to be very careful to close the Behrwald door tightly behind you as you leave.

## Old Testament [Jer. 11:18-20 ESV]

> [18] The Lord made it known to me and I knew;\
> then you showed me their deeds.\
> [19] But I was like a gentle lamb\
> led to the slaughter.\
> I did not know it was against me\
> they devised schemes, saying,\
> “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,\
> let us cut him off from the land of the living,\
> that his name be remembered no more.”\
> [20] But, O Lord of hosts, who judges righteously,\
> who tests the heart and the mind,\
> let me see your vengeance upon them,\
> for to you have I committed my cause.

## Epistle [James 3:13-4:10 ESV; sermon text]

[13] Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. [14] But if 
you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. [15] This is not the wisdom
that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. [16] For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will
be disorder and every vile practice. [17] But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full 
of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. [18] And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

[4:1] What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? [2] You 
desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do 
not ask. [3] You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. [4] You adulterous people! Do 
you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes 
himself an enemy of God. [5] Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit
that he has made to dwell in us”? [6] But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the
humble.” [7] Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. [8] Draw near to God, and he will 
draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. [9] Be wretched and mourn and weep.
Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. [10] Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.

[13] Τίς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων ἐν ὑμῖν; δειξάτω ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐν πραΰτητι σοφίας. 
[14] εἰ δὲ ζῆλον πικρὸν ἔχετε καὶ ἐριθείαν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν, μὴ κατακαυχᾶσθε καὶ ψεύδεσθε κατὰ τῆς ἀληθείας. 
[15] οὐκ ἔστιν αὕτη ἡ σοφία ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη, ἀλλὰ ἐπίγειος, ψυχική, δαιμονιώδης: 
[16] ὅπου γὰρ ζῆλος καὶ ἐριθεία, ἐκεῖ ἀκαταστασία καὶ πᾶν φαῦλον πρᾶγμα. 
[17] ἡ δὲ ἄνωθεν σοφία πρῶτον μὲν ἁγνή ἐστιν, ἔπειτα εἰρηνική, ἐπιεικής, εὐπειθής, μεστὴ ἐλέους καὶ καρπῶν ἀγαθῶν, ἀδιάκριτος, ἀνυπόκριτος: 
[18] καρπὸς δὲ δικαιοσύνης ἐν εἰρήνῃ σπείρεται τοῖς ποιοῦσιν εἰρήνην.

[1] Πόθεν πόλεμοι καὶ πόθεν μάχαι ἐν ὑμῖν; οὐκ ἐντεῦθεν, ἐκ τῶν ἡδονῶν ὑμῶν τῶν στρατευομένων ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ὑμῶν; 
[2] ἐπιθυμεῖτε, καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε: φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε, καὶ οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν: μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε. οὐκ ἔχετε διὰ τὸ μὴ αἰτεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς: 
[3] αἰτεῖτε καὶ οὐ λαμβάνετε, διότι κακῶς αἰτεῖσθε, ἵνα ἐν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς ὑμῶν δαπανήσητε. 
[4] μοιχαλίδες, οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου ἔχθρα τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν; ὃς ἐὰν οὖν βουληθῇ φίλος εἶναι τοῦ κόσμου, ἐχθρὸς τοῦ θεοῦ καθίσταται. 
[5] ἢ δοκεῖτε ὅτι κενῶς ἡ γραφὴ λέγει, Πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ τὸ πνεῦμα ὃ κατῴκισεν ἐν ἡμῖν; 
[6] μείζονα δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν: διὸ λέγει, Ὁ θεὸς ὑπερηφάνοις ἀντιτάσσεται, ταπεινοῖς δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν. 
[7] ὑποτάγητε οὖν τῷ θεῷ: ἀντίστητε δὲ τῷ διαβόλῳ, καὶ φεύξεται ἀφ' ὑμῶν: 
[8] ἐγγίσατε τῷ θεῷ, καὶ ἐγγιεῖ ὑμῖν. καθαρίσατε χεῖρας, ἁμαρτωλοί, καὶ ἁγνίσατε καρδίας, δίψυχοι. 
[9] ταλαιπωρήσατε καὶ πενθήσατε καὶ κλαύσατε: ὁ γέλως ὑμῶν εἰς πένθος μετατραπήτω καὶ ἡ χαρὰ εἰς κατήφειαν. 
[10] ταπεινώθητε ἐνώπιον κυρίου, καὶ ὑψώσει ὑμᾶς.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 9:30-37 ESV]

[30] They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, [31] for he was teaching his 
disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when 
he is killed, after three days he will rise.” [32] But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
[33] And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?” [34] But 
they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. [35] And he sat down and called 
the twelve. And he said to them, “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.” [36] And he took a child
and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, [37] “Whoever receives one such child in my name 
receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.” 

## Introit [Ps 37:5-7; antiphon: Ps 37:4]

> Delight yourself | in the LORD,\*\
> and he will give you the desires | of your heart.\
> Commit your way | to the LORD;\*\
> trust in him, and | he will act.\
> He will bring forth your righteousness | as the light,\*\
> and your justice as the | noonday.\
> Be still before the LORD and wait patiently | for him;\*\
> fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil de- | vices!\

## Notes

Jas 3:41. ἐριθείαν, according to greekbible.com, is "electioneering or intriguing for office." Theologically, it is to put oneself forward.

Jas 4:1 ἡδονῶν, according to greekbible.com, is "pleasure or desire for pleasure." KJV translates this as *lusts*: **"From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"**

Jas 4:5. This is no known Bible verse.
