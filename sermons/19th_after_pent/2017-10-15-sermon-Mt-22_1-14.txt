## Old Testament [Is 25:6‑9 ESV]

> [6] On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples\
> a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine,\
> of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined.\
> [7] And he will swallow up on this mountain\
> the covering that is cast over all peoples,\
> the veil that is spread over all nations.\
> [8] 	He will swallow up death forever;\
> and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces,\
> and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth,\
> for the LORD has spoken.\
> [9] It will be said on that day,\
> “Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he might save us.\
> This is the LORD; we have waited for him;\
> let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”

## Epistle [Php 4:4‑13 ESV]

[4] Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. [5] Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; [6] do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. [7] And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

[8] Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. [9] What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

[10] I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. [11] Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. [12] I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. [13] I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 22:1‑14 ESV; sermon text]

[1] And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, [2] “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, [3] and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. [4] Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’ [5] But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, [6] while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. [7] The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. [8] Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. [9] Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’ [10] And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.

[11] “But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. [12] And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless. [13] Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ [14] For many are called, but few are chosen.”

[1] Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς πάλιν εἶπεν ἐν παραβολαῖς αὐτοῖς λέγων, 
[2] Ὡμοιώθη ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ βασιλεῖ, ὅστις ἐποίησεν γάμους τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ. 
[3] καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ καλέσαι τοὺς κεκλημένους εἰς τοὺς γάμους, καὶ οὐκ ἤθελον ἐλθεῖν. 
[4] πάλιν ἀπέστειλεν ἄλλους δούλους λέγων, Εἴπατε τοῖς κεκλημένοις, Ἰδοὺ τὸ ἄριστόν μου ἡτοίμακα, οἱ ταῦροί μου καὶ τὰ σιτιστὰ τεθυμένα, καὶ πάντα ἕτοιμα: δεῦτε εἰς τοὺς γάμους. 
[5] οἱ δὲ ἀμελήσαντες ἀπῆλθον, ὃς μὲν εἰς τὸν ἴδιον ἀγρόν, ὃς δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν ἐμπορίαν αὐτοῦ: 
[6] οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ κρατήσαντες τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ὕβρισαν καὶ ἀπέκτειναν. 
[7] ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ὠργίσθη, καὶ πέμψας τὰ στρατεύματα αὐτοῦ ἀπώλεσεν τοὺς φονεῖς ἐκείνους καὶ τὴν πόλιν αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησεν. 
[8] τότε λέγει τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ, Ὁ μὲν γάμος ἕτοιμός ἐστιν, οἱ δὲ κεκλημένοι οὐκ ἦσαν ἄξιοι: 
[9] πορεύεσθε οὖν ἐπὶ τὰς διεξόδους τῶν ὁδῶν, καὶ ὅσους ἐὰν εὕρητε καλέσατε εἰς τοὺς γάμους. 
[10] καὶ ἐξελθόντες οἱ δοῦλοι ἐκεῖνοι εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς συνήγαγον πάντας οὓς εὗρον, πονηρούς τε καὶ ἀγαθούς: καὶ ἐπλήσθη ὁ γάμος ἀνακειμένων. 

[11] εἰσελθὼν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς θεάσασθαι τοὺς ἀνακειμένους εἶδεν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπον οὐκ ἐνδεδυμένον ἔνδυμα γάμου: 
[12] καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Ἑταῖρε, πῶς εἰσῆλθες ὧδε μὴ ἔχων ἔνδυμα γάμου; ὁ δὲ ἐφιμώθη. 
[13] τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς εἶπεν τοῖς διακόνοις, Δήσαντες αὐτοῦ πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ἐκβάλετε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον: ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων. 
[14] πολλοὶ γάρ εἰσιν κλητοὶ ὀλίγοι δὲ ἐκλεκτοί.

## Introit [Is 61:10; antiphon: Ps 146:2]

> I will praise the LORD as long | as I live;\*\
> I will sing praises to my God while I have my | being.\
> I will greatly rejoice | in the LORD;\*\
> my soul shall exult | in my God,\
> for he has clothed me with the garments of sal- | vation;\*\
> he has covered me with the robe of | righteousness,\
> as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful | headdress,\*\

## Collect

Almighty God, You invite us to trust in You for our salvation. Deal with us not in the severity of Your judgment but by the greatness of Your mercy; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, *[Point to stained glass window.]* I was not sitting at Jesus' feet when He taught the Sermon on the Mount.
*[Point to the stained glass window.]* I was not sitting at the table when He instituted Holy Communion.
*[Point to the Crucifixion window.]* I was not there when they crucified my Lord, though it does make me tremble.
After He was raised for the dead and ascended into heaven, the book of Acts records that Christians **devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers** [(Ac 2:42 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+2/).

I was not there when the early Christians met in the book of Acts, but the *breaking of bread* could very well have been Holy Communion---both the bread and the wine---for the Bible can speak of a part when it means the whole.
For example, does not our Lord Jesus say, **"This _cup_ that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood"** [(Lk 22:20 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22/)?
Yet there is wine *in* the cup, and by saying "cup," He includes the wine and says about the *wine*, "*This* is **the new covenant in My blood**."
The Church has never considered the cup to be the new covenant in Jesus' blood: the *wine* is the new covenant in Jesus' blood. This is simply how our Lord speaks.

Whether or not the *breaking of bread* in Acts 2:42 is Holy Communion or not, there are records that indicate that early Christians continued to assemble to hear God's Word---they assembled to hear Paul's letters read to them but especially *the Gospels*.
Our New Testament begins with the four Gospels---Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John---because they were given to us in this order by Christians around the year 400 who said, "These books are in the New Testament and the others are out."
And of all of these books, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are *first*, and our custom to honor them by standing for the Gospel reading probably goes back over a thousand years.

Again, I was not there to attend early Christian church services---and what we have in the Bible is sufficient to tell us what we need to know to live as Christians today---but I have learned from my study *outside* of the Bible that when the Scriptures were heard in the early church days, it was likely that the *whole book* was read to the congregation during the church service *and I would love to do that someday*---to have a whole book of the Bible heard right here in public.
Anyone in Bible study knows that we normally do not read just verses from the Bible but *whole sections* from the Bible.
Well, lets improve on that *[Point to the lectern.]* and hear *whole books* of the Bible from beginning to end.
Then we would be doing what the early Christians did when they assembled together for worship.

Christians would listen to the Bible for a long time, and then they would have *Holy Communion*.
The non-communicant members were asked to leave the church and then the Communion service began for the communicant members after the whole book of the Bible had been heard.
Holy Communion is a mysterious meal instituted by Christ Himself:

> **Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was betrayed took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to His disciples and said, "Take, eat, this is My body." ...**

So, it is no stretch to hear the Holy Gospel today---**"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son."**---and recognize that the Son is Jesus and that the wedding feast is Holy Communion.
It is by God's gracious invitation that sinners *[Point to the altar.]* are invited to this table as honored guests.

Yet the invited guests do not come.

> **Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’ But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business.**

What would keep you from coming to Holy Communion, and how would your heavenly Father think of it.

> **While the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.**

And there is no lack of the king's messengers---messengers of the kingdom of Christ---who have been treated shamefully and killed, who wanted only to extend the invitation to repent, believe on Jesus who on the Cross atoned for your sins, and who feeds you with His same body and blood at the altar---given and shed for your for the forgiveness of sins.

> **Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’ And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.**

Our heavenly Father is bound and determined to fill His wedding hall here on earth and in heaven.
"Fill the hall! Fill it with the good and the evil, for there is forgiveness in the name of My Son Jesus!"
The wedding hall is filled with guests.

> **But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.**

What is this wedding garment with which we are to be clothed at Christ's wedding feast?
What I want you to know and did not learn until I was in seminary is that the ancient custom was to *give* a wedding garment to each invited guest.
You were *given* the clothes to wear to the wedding; you did not go shopping for your wedding outfit.
The man with no wedding garment did not take the trouble to put it on.

Beloved in the Lord, you wear *Christ* as a wedding garment!
St. Paul writes in Galatians, chapter 3,

> **For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.** [(Gal 3:26‑27 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+3/)

As surely as God has baptized you, He has clothed you with Christ---He has clothed you with your wedding garment.

But you can take your wedding garment off.
One way, I would say, is by cheap grace.
You do not want to be coming to the Lord's table expecting cheap grace, saying about your sin, "You know, things happen."
Your sin grieves the Holy Spirit: **Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption** (Eph 4:30 ESV).

Come to the wedding feast wearing your wedding clothes.
AMEN.

## Notes

The Holy Gospel was surely understood to man Holy Communion. We are not the guests at this wedding feast: we are the bride.

Though this is not a Communion Sunday, it may be nice to have Communion every Sunday.
