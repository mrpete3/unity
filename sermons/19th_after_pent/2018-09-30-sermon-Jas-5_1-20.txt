## Old Testament [Nm 11:4-6, 10-16, 24-29 ESV]

[4] Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also wept again and said, “Oh that we had meat to eat! 
[5] We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
[6] But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”

...

[10] Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the Lord blazed 
hotly, and Moses was displeased. [11] Moses said to the Lord, “Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found
favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? [12] Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth,
that you should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child,’ to the land that you swore to give their
fathers? [13] Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’
[14] I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me. [15] If you will treat me like this, kill me 
at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.”

[16] Then the Lord said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you. 

...

[24] So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and 
placed them around the tent. [25] Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.

[26] Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were 
among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp. [27] And a young man ran and 
told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” [28] And Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth,
said, “My lord Moses, stop them.” [29] But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord's people were
prophets, that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!” 

## Epistle [James 5:(1-12) 13-20 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. [2] Your riches have rotted and your garments
are moth-eaten. [3] Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh
like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days. [4] Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept
back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. [5] You 
have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. [6] You have 
condemned and murdered the righteous person. He does not resist you.

[7] Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth,
being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains. [8] You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, for the
coming of the Lord is at hand. [9] Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge
is standing at the door. [10] As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the 
Lord. [11] Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have 
seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.

[12] But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your “yes” be yes and 
your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.

[13] Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. [14] Is anyone among you sick? Let 
him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. [15] And the 
prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
[16] Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous 
person has great power as it is working. [17] Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might 
not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. [18] Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and 
the earth bore its fruit.

[19] My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, [20] let him know that whoever brings 
back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

[1] Ἄγε νῦν οἱ πλούσιοι, κλαύσατε ὀλολύζοντες ἐπὶ ταῖς ταλαιπωρίαις ὑμῶν ταῖς ἐπερχομέναις. 
[2] ὁ πλοῦτος ὑμῶν σέσηπεν καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν σητόβρωτα γέγονεν, 
[3] ὁ χρυσὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ ἄργυρος κατίωται, καὶ ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῶν εἰς μαρτύριον ὑμῖν ἔσται καὶ φάγεται τὰς σάρκας ὑμῶν ὡς πῦρ: ἐθησαυρίσατε ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις. 
[4] ἰδοὺ ὁ μισθὸς τῶν ἐργατῶν τῶν ἀμησάντων τὰς χώρας ὑμῶν ὁ ἀπεστερημένος ἀφ' ὑμῶν κράζει, καὶ αἱ βοαὶ τῶν θερισάντων εἰς τὰ ὦτα κυρίου Σαβαὼθ εἰσεληλύθασιν. 
[5] ἐτρυφήσατε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐσπαταλήσατε, ἐθρέψατε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς. 
[6] κατεδικάσατε, ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον. οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν. 

[7] Μακροθυμήσατε οὖν, ἀδελφοί, ἕως τῆς παρουσίας τοῦ κυρίου. ἰδοὺ ὁ γεωργὸς ἐκδέχεται τὸν τίμιον καρπὸν τῆς γῆς, μακροθυμῶν ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἕως λάβῃ πρόϊμον καὶ ὄψιμον. 
[8] μακροθυμήσατε καὶ ὑμεῖς, στηρίξατε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν, ὅτι ἡ παρουσία τοῦ κυρίου ἤγγικεν. 
[9] μὴ στενάζετε, ἀδελφοί, κατ' ἀλλήλων, ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε: ἰδοὺ ὁ κριτὴς πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν ἕστηκεν. 
[10] ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε, ἀδελφοί, τῆς κακοπαθίας καὶ τῆς μακροθυμίας τοὺς προφήτας, οἳ ἐλάλησαν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι κυρίου. 
[11] ἰδοὺ μακαρίζομεν τοὺς ὑπομείναντας: τὴν ὑπομονὴν Ἰὼβ ἠκούσατε, καὶ τὸ τέλος κυρίου εἴδετε, ὅτι πολύσπλαγχνός ἐστιν ὁ κύριος καὶ οἰκτίρμων. 

[12] Πρὸ πάντων δέ, ἀδελφοί μου, μὴ ὀμνύετε, μήτε τὸν οὐρανὸν μήτε τὴν γῆν μήτε ἄλλον τινὰ ὅρκον: ἤτω δὲ ὑμῶν τὸ Ναὶ ναὶ καὶ τὸ Οὒ οὔ, ἵνα μὴ ὑπὸ κρίσιν πέσητε. 

[13] Κακοπαθεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν; προσευχέσθω: εὐθυμεῖ τις; ψαλλέτω. 
[14] ἀσθενεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν; προσκαλεσάσθω τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς ἐκκλησίας, καὶ προσευξάσθωσαν ἐπ' αὐτὸν ἀλείψαντες [αὐτὸν] ἐλαίῳ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ κυρίου: 
[15] καὶ ἡ εὐχὴ τῆς πίστεως σώσει τὸν κάμνοντα, καὶ ἐγερεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος: κἂν ἁμαρτίας ᾖ πεποιηκώς, ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ. 
[16] ἐξομολογεῖσθε οὖν ἀλλήλοις τὰς ἁμαρτίας καὶ εὔχεσθε ὑπὲρ ἀλλήλων, ὅπως ἰαθῆτε. πολὺ ἰσχύει δέησις δικαίου ἐνεργουμένη. 
[17] Ἠλίας ἄνθρωπος ἦν ὁμοιοπαθὴς ἡμῖν, καὶ προσευχῇ προσηύξατο τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι, καὶ οὐκ ἔβρεξεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐνιαυτοὺς τρεῖς καὶ μῆνας ἕξ: 
[18] καὶ πάλιν προσηύξατο, καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς ὑετὸν ἔδωκεν καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐβλάστησεν τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῆς. 

[19] Ἀδελφοί μου, ἐάν τις ἐν ὑμῖν πλανηθῇ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ ἐπιστρέψῃ τις αὐτόν, 
[20] γινωσκέτω ὅτι ὁ ἐπιστρέψας ἁμαρτωλὸν ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ θανάτου καὶ καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 9:38-50 ESV]

[38] John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not 
following us.” [39] But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward 
to speak evil of me. [40] For the one who is not against us is for us. [41] For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of 
water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.

[42] “Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were 
hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. [43] And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you 
to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. [45] And if your foot causes you to sin, cut
it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. [47] And if your eye causes you to sin,
tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, [48] ‘where
their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.’ [49] For everyone will be salted with fire. [50] Salt is good, but if the 
salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”

## Introit [Ps 135:1-3, 13-14; antiphon: Ps 135:13]
