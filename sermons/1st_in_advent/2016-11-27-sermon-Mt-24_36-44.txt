## First reading [Is 2:1‑5 ESV]

> [1] The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.\
> [2] It shall come to pass in the latter days\
> that the mountain of the house of the LORD\
> shall be established as the highest of the mountains,\
> and shall be lifted up above the hills;\
> and all the nations shall flow to it,\
> [3] and many peoples shall come, and say:\
> “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,\
> to the house of the God of Jacob,\
> that he may teach us his ways\
> and that we may walk in his paths.”\
> For out of Zion shall go forth the law,\
> and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.\
> [4] He shall judge between the nations,\
> and shall decide disputes for many peoples;\
> and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,\
> and their spears into pruning hooks;\
> nation shall not lift up sword against nation,\
> neither shall they learn war anymore.\
> [5] O house of Jacob,\
> come, let us walk in the light of the LORD.

> [1] ῾Ο λόγος ὁ γενόμενος παρὰ κυρίου πρὸς Ησαιαν υἱὸν Αμως περὶ τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ περὶ Ιερουσαλημ.\
> [2] ῞Οτι ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις ἐμφανὲς τὸ ὄρος κυρίου καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπ᾽ ἄκρων τῶν ὀρέων καὶ ὑψωθήσεται ὑπεράνω τῶν βουνῶν· καὶ ἥξουσιν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη,\
> [3] καὶ πορεύσονται ἔθνη πολλὰ καὶ ἐροῦσιν Δεῦτε καὶ ἀναβῶμεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος κυρίου καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ Ιακωβ, καὶ ἀναγγελεῖ ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πορευσόμεθα ἐν αὐτῇ· ἐκ γὰρ Σιων ἐξελεύσεται νόμος καὶ λόγος κυρίου ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ.\
> [4] καὶ κρινεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ ἐλέγξει λαὸν πολύν, καὶ συγκόψουσιν τὰς μαχαίρας αὐτῶν εἰς ἄροτρα καὶ τὰς ζιβύνας αὐτῶν εἰς δρέπανα, καὶ οὐ λήμψεται ἔτι ἔθνος ἐπ᾽ ἔθνος μάχαιραν, καὶ οὐ μὴ μάθωσιν ἔτι πολεμεῖν.\
> [5] Καὶ νῦν, ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Ιακωβ, δεῦτε πορευθῶμεν τῷ φωτὶ κυρίου.


## Epistle [Rm 13:8‑14 ESV]

[8] Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

[11] Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. [12] The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. [13] Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. [14] But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.

[8] Μηδενὶ μηδὲν ὀφείλετε, εἰ μὴ τὸ ἀλλήλους ἀγαπᾶν: ὁ γὰρ ἀγαπῶν τὸν ἕτερον νόμον πεπλήρωκεν. 
[9] τὸ γὰρ Οὐ μοιχεύσεις, Οὐ φονεύσεις, Οὐ κλέψεις, Οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις, καὶ εἴ τις ἑτέρα ἐντολή, ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ ἀνακεφαλαιοῦται, [ἐν τῷ] Ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν. 
[10] ἡ ἀγάπη τῷ πλησίον κακὸν οὐκ ἐργάζεται: πλήρωμα οὖν νόμου ἡ ἀγάπη. 

[11] Καὶ τοῦτο εἰδότες τὸν καιρόν, ὅτι ὥρα ἤδη ὑμᾶς ἐξ ὕπνου ἐγερθῆναι, νῦν γὰρ ἐγγύτερον ἡμῶν ἡ σωτηρία ἢ ὅτε ἐπιστεύσαμεν. 
[12] ἡ νὺξ προέκοψεν, ἡ δὲ ἡμέρα ἤγγικεν. ἀποθώμεθα οὖν τὰ ἔργα τοῦ σκότους, ἐνδυσώμεθα [δὲ] τὰ ὅπλα τοῦ φωτός. 
[13] ὡς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ εὐσχημόνως περιπατήσωμεν, μὴ κώμοις καὶ μέθαις, μὴ κοίταις καὶ ἀσελγείαις, μὴ ἔριδι καὶ ζήλῳ: 
[14] ἀλλὰ ἐνδύσασθε τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν, καὶ τῆς σαρκὸς πρόνοιαν μὴ ποιεῖσθε εἰς ἐπιθυμίας.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 21:1‑11 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, [2] saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. [3] If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.” [4] This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,

> [5] “Say to the daughter of Zion,\
> ‘Behold, your king is coming to you,\
> humble, and mounted on a donkey,\
> on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”
	
[6] The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. [7] They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. [8] Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. [9] And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” [10] And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?” [11] And the crowds said, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”

[1] Καὶ ὅτε ἤγγισαν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Βηθφαγὴ εἰς τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν, τότε Ἰησοῦς ἀπέστειλεν δύο μαθητὰς 
[2] λέγων αὐτοῖς, Πορεύεσθε εἰς τὴν κώμην τὴν κατέναντι ὑμῶν, καὶ εὐθέως εὑρήσετε ὄνον δεδεμένην καὶ πῶλον μετ' αὐτῆς: λύσαντες ἀγάγετέ μοι. 
[3] καὶ ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ τι, ἐρεῖτε ὅτι Ὁ κύριος αὐτῶν χρείαν ἔχει: εὐθὺς δὲ ἀποστελεῖ αὐτούς. 
[4] Τοῦτο δὲ γέγονεν ἵνα πληρωθῇ τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ τοῦ προφήτου λέγοντος, 

> [5] Εἴπατε τῇ θυγατρὶ Σιών, Ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεύς σου ἔρχεταί σοι, πραῢς καὶ ἐπιβεβηκὼς ἐπὶ ὄνον, καὶ ἐπὶ πῶλον υἱὸν ὑποζυγίου. 

[6] πορευθέντες δὲ οἱ μαθηταὶ καὶ ποιήσαντες καθὼς συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς 
[7] ἤγαγον τὴν ὄνον καὶ τὸν πῶλον, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπ' αὐτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ ἐπεκάθισεν ἐπάνω αὐτῶν. 
[8] ὁ δὲ πλεῖστος ὄχλος ἔστρωσαν ἑαυτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ἄλλοι δὲ ἔκοπτον κλάδους ἀπὸ τῶν δένδρων καὶ ἐστρώννυον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ. 
[9] οἱ δὲ ὄχλοι οἱ προάγοντες αὐτὸν καὶ οἱ ἀκολουθοῦντες ἔκραζον λέγοντες, Ὡσαννὰ τῷ υἱῷ Δαυίδ: Εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου: Ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις. 
[10] καὶ εἰσελθόντος αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα ἐσείσθη πᾶσα ἡ πόλις λέγουσα, Τίς ἐστιν οὗτος; 
[11] οἱ δὲ ὄχλοι ἔλεγον, Οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ προφήτης Ἰησοῦς ὁ ἀπὸ Ναζαρὲθ τῆς Γαλιλαίας.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving, all of you!
I did. As you know, my parents were in town and that, as a matter of fact was my birthday present.
I had asked in September for my birthday that my parents would come visit me, and they did!
And Aadu and Jaan were home, so what else could I ask for?
We sat in peace around the dinner table with thankful hearts and enjoyed each other's company very much.
I could not have asked for more.

But at this time of the year we think of our military.
Many of our soldiers had to spend Thanksgiving away from home and in dangerous places.
Think of the consequences when nations actually fight each other and engulfed in war.
To say that it ruins Thanksgiving for a lot of people is an understatement.
I have never served in the military nor have I ever experienced war, so I can really say nothing about it, other than others have served in the military and others have experienced war so I could live in peace.
And that were it not for *American* servicemen and women, I would not have had a nice Thanksgiving and, frankly, I would not have even been born!
Thank you!

In war, I have been told, people are killing each other violently, one at a time or by the tens, hundreds, and thousands.
Negotiation and goodwill have broken down and people are dying everywhere; everyone's lives are disrupted and harder.
I mention this because our Old Testament reading says that Jesus comes to put an end to this.
The prophet Isaiah, writing around 700&nbsp;B.C., proclaimed,

> **He shall judge between the nations,**\
> **and shall decide disputes for many peoples;**\
> **and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,**\
> **and their spears into pruning hooks;**\
> **nation shall not lift up sword against nation,**\
> **neither shall they learn war anymore.** [(Is&nbsp;2:4)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%202%3A4/)

Imagine that there is someone who will put an end to war.
Well, He's coming!
Thank God, He's coming!

The prophet Zechariah, writing around 520&nbsp;B.C., proclaimed,

> **Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!**\
> **Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!**\
> **Behold, your king is coming to you;**\
> **righteous and having salvation is he,**\
> **humble and mounted on a donkey,**\
> **on a colt, the foal of a donkey.** [(Zec&nbsp;9:9 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Zechariah%209%3A9/)

Now we know who this King is, who will bring peace to the nations.
He will be mounted on a donkey, and, as you know, this is exactly how Jesus
entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, as our Holy Gospel in Matthew, chapter&nbsp;24, clearly declares.
He's coming to Jerusalem ... and He came on Palm Sunday---to do what?
Die on the Cross on Good Friday as you very well know.
Did the prophets know anything about this?
Why yes, even the prophet Zechariah told us in chapter&nbsp;3,

> **&ldquo;Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch. For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with seven eyes, I will engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, _and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day_. In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree.&rdquo;** [(Zec&nbsp;3:8&#x2011;10 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Zechariah%203%3A8-10/)

He's coming, but He came. Our unbelief is a greater than the sins of war.

AMEN.
