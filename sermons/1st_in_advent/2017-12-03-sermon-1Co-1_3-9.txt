## Old Testament [Is 64:1‑9 ESV]

> [1] Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,\
> that the mountains might quake at your presence—\
> [2]  as when fire kindles brushwood\
> and the fire causes water to boil—\
> to make your name known to your adversaries,\
> and that the nations might tremble at your presence!\
> [3] When you did awesome things that we did not look for,\
> you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.\
> [4] From of old no one has heard\
> or perceived by the ear,\
> no eye has seen a God besides you,\
> who acts for those who wait for him.\
> [5] You meet him who joyfully works righteousness,\
> those who remember you in your ways.\
> Behold, you were angry, and we sinned;\
> in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?\
> [6] We have all become like one who is unclean,\
> and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.\
> We all fade like a leaf,\
> and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.\
> [7] There is no one who calls upon your name,\
> who rouses himself to take hold of you;\
> for you have hidden your face from us,\
> and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities.

> [8] But now, O LORD, you are our Father;\
> we are the clay, and you are our potter;\
> we are all the work of your hand.\
> [9] Be not so terribly angry, O LORD,\
> and remember not iniquity forever.\
> Behold, please look, we are all your people.

## Epistle [1Co 1:3‑9 ESV; sermon text]

[3] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
[4] I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, 
[5] that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge— 
[6] even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you— 
[7] so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
[8] who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
[9] God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

[3] χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ. 
[4] Εὐχαριστῶ τῷ θεῷ μου πάντοτε περὶ ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τῇ χάριτι τοῦ θεοῦ τῇ δοθείσῃ ὑμῖν ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, 
[5] ὅτι ἐν παντὶ ἐπλουτίσθητε ἐν αὐτῷ, ἐν παντὶ λόγῳ καὶ πάσῃ γνώσει, 
[6] καθὼς τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐβεβαιώθη ἐν ὑμῖν, 
[7] ὥστε ὑμᾶς μὴ ὑστερεῖσθαι ἐν μηδενὶ χαρίσματι, ἀπεκδεχομένους τὴν ἀποκάλυψιν τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ: 
[8] ὃς καὶ βεβαιώσει ὑμᾶς ἕως τέλους ἀνεγκλήτους ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ [Χριστοῦ]. 
[9] πιστὸς ὁ θεὸς δι' οὗ ἐκλήθητε εἰς κοινωνίαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 11:1‑10 ESV]

[1] Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples 
[2] and said to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. 
[3] If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’” 
[4] And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. 
[5] And some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 
[6] And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. 
[7] And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. 
[8] And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. 
[9] And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! 
[10] Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!”

## Introit [Ps 25:1-3; antiphon: Zech 9:9b]

> Behold, your king is com- | ing to you;\*\
> righteous and having sal- | vation.\
> To you, | O LORD,\*\
> I lift | up my soul.\
> O my God, in you I trust; let me not be | put to shame;\*\
> let not my enemies exult | over me.\
> Indeed, none who wait for you shall be | put to shame;\*\
> they shall be ashamed who are wantonly | treacherous.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

"Thanks, I don't need any help."

"Do you need any help?"

"No, I'm good."

"No, you're not."

> **"But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags."** [(Is 64:6 KJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is+64%3A6&version=KJV)

Before God, we are *all* as an unclean thing, and all our righteous deeds are as filthy rags before God.

"Do you need any help?"

"Yes! Please help me!"

And here comes our Lord Jesus saddled on a colt.

> **"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"** [(Mk 11:9 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk+11%3A9&version=ESV)

AMEN.
