## Old Testament reading [Jer 33:14‑16 ESV]

[14] “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house 
of Judah. [15] In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice
and righteousness in the land. [16] In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by
which it will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’

## Epistle [1 Thes 3:9‑13 ESV]

[9] For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God, [10] as we pray
most earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?
[11] Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, [12] and may the Lord make you increase and 
abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, [13] so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness 
before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 21:25‑36 ESV; Sermon text]

[25] “And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring
of the sea and the waves, [26] people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the
heavens will be shaken. [27] And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. [28] Now when 
these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”
[29] And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. [30] As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for 
yourselves and know that the summer is already near. [31] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the 
kingdom of God is near. [32] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. [33] Heaven and 
earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
[34] “But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day
come upon you suddenly like a trap. [35] For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. [36] But stay awake 
at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the
Son of Man.”
