## Old Testament reading [Jer 33:14‑16 ESV; sermon text]

[14] "Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house 
of Judah.
[15] In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. [16] In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’"

## Epistle [1 Thes 3:9‑13 ESV]

[9] For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God, [10] as we pray
most earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?
[11] Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, [12] and may the Lord make you increase and 
abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, [13] so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness 
before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 21:25‑36 ESV]

[25] “And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring
of the sea and the waves, [26] people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the
heavens will be shaken. [27] And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. [28] Now when 
these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”

[29] And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. [30] As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for 
yourselves and know that the summer is already near. [31] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the 
kingdom of God is near. [32] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. [33] Heaven and 
earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

[34] “But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day
come upon you suddenly like a trap. [35] For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. [36] But stay awake 
at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the
Son of Man.”

## Introit [Ps 89:6, 14-16, 18; antiphon: Zech 9:9b]

> Behold, your king is co- | ming to you;\*\
> righteous and having sal- | vation.\
> Who in the skies can be compared | to the LORD?\*\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Let us bring in the New Year together, and I am not talking about the New Year's Eve service which will be held at 6:30 on New Year's Eve at St. Mark.
I am talking about *today*.
I am talking about the new *church* year and today is New Year's Day---the First Sunday in Advent; our calendar for the new *church* year begins *today*.
The Advent wreath is out with three blue candles and a pink candle;
Trevon lit the first candle today, and that first candle and the corresponding banner are for *Hope*.
There is hope in Jesus when we are overwhelmed by our sin.

Hope is what we need in the face of our sin, and hope is what the Israelites had in the face of their sin---hope from the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah.
We hear in our Old Testament reading today the prophet Jermiah tell us about the hope we *and* the Israelites have in the face of our overwhelming sin.
Though our reading is full of hope, I will impress upon you from God's Word that this hope is a relief from God's jealous punishment of idolatry.
Jeremiah declares to us the Righteous Branch who will establish righteousness and justice, which the message of hope---the promise of a Savior who establishes those two jewels of God's kingdom: justice and righteousness.
However, much of Jeremiah's prophecy is a stark, overpowering condemnation of sin, especially of idolatry, and I should not skip over that.
In other words, if you are inclined to take your sin lightly, listen to what God says about your sin and what He thinks of you when you cling to your idols.

What is the difference between idolatry and other sin?
Here the order of the Ten Commandments is helpful, for we know that the First Commandment---**"You shall have no other gods before Me"**---tells us to have no idols.
*What does this mean? We should fear, love, and trust, in God above all things,* and get rid of our idols.
Well, if you break the First Commandment, guess what?
That is just the beginning: by your idolatry you have set yourself to break all the others now.
What God observed with the Israelites is that they began with idolatry---they were influenced by their foreign associates to worship their gods.
An association with an unbeliever is a risky thing.
What followed was that sin spread---idolatry was only a beginning---and they were overwhelmed.

> **Everyone deceives his neighbor, and no one speaks the truth;**\
> **they have taught their tongue to speak lies;**\
> **they weary themselves committing iniquity.**
> [They sin so much, they're wiped out!]\
> **Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit,**\
> **they refuse to know me, declares the LORD.** ([Jer 9:5‑6](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+9:5/) ESV)

This verse from Jeremiah, chapter 9 should impress upon you that what started with a little leak of idolatry opened the floodwaters of sin.
**"Heaping oppression upon oppression"**---by *oppression*, God means that He has an eye on the widow, the fatherless, and the foreigner: are they being cared for or are their lives difficult and getting worse?
Again, we hear from Jeremiah,

> **Thus says the LORD: _Do_ justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the resident alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.** ([Jer 22:3](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+22:3/) ESV)

By the same Spirit, the prophet Isaiah points out that justice and righteousness are *not* being done by the Israelites:

> **For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts**\
> **is the house of Israel,**\
> **and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting;**\
> **and he looked for justice, but behold, _bloodshed_;**\
> **for righteousness, but behold, an _outcry_!** ([Is 5:7](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+5:7/) ESV)

Where the LORD looks for justice, He sees innocent blood shed; where He looks for righteousness, people are crying out for all the wrong being done to them.
The question is: If the Israelites were not doing justice and righteousness, how are *we* doing?
The answer is that if you or I are dabbling in idolatry---even the simple idolatry of money---we will soon enough be responsible for outcry and bloodshed---we will be unable to do what is just and unable to do what is right, which brings us to the next point.

Note well---this is found elsewhere in the Bible as well---not only from the mouth of Jeremiah ([Ezk 23](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+23/))---that God speaks of *adultery* and He speaks of *fornication* to describe idolatry---He expresses Himself as an angry but faithful husband whose unfaithful wife gives her body to other men.
That is how God views our idolatry.
Jeremiah, chapter 3, has such a passage, and I will not even read it to you because though it is the Word of God, I, as your pastor, do not feel comfortable reading this passage word-for-word from the pulpit because it contains language that could throw you for a loop so that you do not even hear the rest of the sermon.
But when you are at home, I invite you to read Jeremiah, chapter 3 for yourself and be reminded you serious God takes idolatry.
(Help us, dear Lord Jesus, *not* be be idolaters!)

How angry is God at idolatry?
Well, He does not say, "You made a mistake; try to remember what I told you next time."
No, He says, "You are worthless" ([Jer 2:5](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+2:5/)).
And, if we are unable to do anything right---if we are unable to do what is just---it is fair to say we are indeed worthless.
Although we are created in God's image, which makes us of great value, our idolatry mangles and defiles that image to the point that we are, in fact, worthless and overwhelmed by our sin to do any good.
(Help us, dear Lord Jesus, not to be worthless!)

So, this is an opportunity for self-examination.
Do I love money more than God?
Has God not given me life?
Has God not fed me?
Has God not given me the opportunity to make a decent living?
*What have I done* to love money more than God? *What have I done?*
It is worthless; I am worthless.
Do I dabble in satanic arts?
Do I interact with the evil spirits in ways God has not commanded me to do, like through mediums and psychics and rituals outside of what Christ has given to His Church?
*[Point to font]* Has Christ not commanded us to baptize?
*[Point to altar]* Has Christ not commanded us to partake of His Holy Supper?
*[Point to lectern and hold up the Bible]* Has Christ not revealed to us His Word and in it everything we need to believe to be saved by faith in Jesus?
*What have I done* to go after Satan's tricks and not stick with the Bible? *What have I done?*
It is worthless; I am worthless.

Do you know what a *euphemism* is?
A euphemism is a gentle way of saying a harsh thing, like "You are a valuable employee, but our budget is tight" instead of "You're a worthless employee and you're fired," or "Honey, I'll always remember the good times we spent together" instead of "I found someone else."
It is precisely with the language of a failed marriage relationship---a marriage that has failed from adultery---that God expresses His thoughts *not* by euphemism but by the opposite of euphemism: by stark, harsh language.
That is what the Israelites earned for their idolatry, and that is what we earn from, God forbid, our idolatry.
Dabble in idolatry and watch all the sins pour in.
You can read from Jeremiah for yourself that God chooses *not* to speak by euphemism but by harsh, angry, punishing language.
Is God out of line for speaking out in this way against idolatry?
I would not go there if I were you.

If I were you, I would review the Ten Commandments and repent.
From the mouth of Jeremiah,

> **O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth?**\
> **You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish;**\
> **you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction.**\
> **They have made their faces harder than rock;**\
> **they have refused to repent.** ([Jer 5:3](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+5:3/) ESV)

> **"Return, faithless Israel, declares the LORD.**\
> **I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful, declares the LORD;**\
> **I will not be angry forever.**\
> **Only acknowledge your guilt,**\
> **that you rebelled against the LORD your God**\
> **and scattered your favors among foreigners under every green tree,**\
> **and that you have not obeyed my voice, declares the LORD."** ([Jer 3:12‑13](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+3:12/) ESV)

For what God intends is to show mercy on us when we acknowledge our guilt and confess our sins.
By the grace of the Holy Spirit, we confessed our sins and acknowledged our guilt at the beginning of this service.
And I declared you, *by Christ's own authority*, forgiven in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
You should be very happy to believe those words, for the prophet Jeremiah tells us why.
Sinners lack one thing, and we lack it b: righteousness.
If we would take God's correction, the Holy Spirit makes us painfully aware of the enormity of our sin and our powerlessness to make it right.
We are tempted to point out the molehill of right things we have done to deflect attention from the mountain of wrong things we have done because we are deceived by Satan into believing that the only way to get out of the mess is to try to undo our bad with out own good.
Believe that, and you will fall deeper and deeper into despair for your sin.

Hear now the promise of the righteous Branch from the mouth of Jeremiah:

**"In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: 'The Lord is our righteousness.'"**

Here Jesus is foretold to be the Branch, who will execute justice and righteousness in the land---those thing that God longs for.
**Those in Judah will be saved**---not only the Jews, but also the Gentiles will be saved from what? *From our unrighteousness!*
How bad do you want to be right but how wrong are you in God's eyes?
Listen to this:

> **"This is the name by which it will be called: 'The Lord is our righteousness.'"**

The righeous Branch Jesus does right perfectly, but did you catch who He is to you?
*Jesus is _your_ righeousness!*
As surely as He is right, you are right.
And this promise of God, beloved in he Lord---this promise of God that Jesus is your righteousness has a miraculous effect.
The satanic arts perform signs and wonders to deceive, but in Christ's Church there is a sign and a wonder every time a sinner repents and believes in Jesus.
For where the atoning blood of Christ is trusted, there the Holy Spirit is to lift that mountain of unrighteousness---that mountain of wrong things he has done---from the sinner's shoulders.
By the grace of the Holy Spirit, the Word of the Cross for sinners creates faith in Jesus in the heart of a sinners and the miraculous lifting of the burden happens.
The fact of the matter is that Jesus is righteous *for me*.
I need not bring up the nature of my deeds, for His deeds speak for me: the Lord is *my* righteousness.

> *Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness*\
> *My beauty are, my glorious dress*.

This is worth singing about and a wonderful way to kick off the new church year.
For we hope not in what we can do to make things right, but in what Jesus has already done to make things right.
May His righteousness fill the land.
**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

					declares the LORD;
	I will not be angry forever.
