## Sermon text [Ps 31:5 ESV]

> [5] Into your hand I commit my spirit;\
> you have redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.

## Old Testament [Is 55:6‑11 ESV]

> [6] “Seek the LORD while he may be found;\
> call upon him while he is near;\
> [7] let the wicked forsake his way,\
> and the unrighteous man his thoughts;\
> let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him,\
> and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\
> [8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,\
> neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.\
> [9] For as the heavens are higher than the earth,\
> so are my ways higher than your ways\
> and my thoughts than your thoughts.

> [10] “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven\
> and do not return there but water the earth,\
> making it bring forth and sprout,\
> giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,\
> [11] so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth;\
> it shall not return to me empty,\
> but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,\
> and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.

## Epistle [Rm 10:5‑17 ESV]

[5] For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. [6] But the righteousness based on faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) [7] “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). [8] But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); [9] because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. [10] For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. [11] For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” [12] For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. [13] For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

[14] How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? [15] And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!” [16] But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?” [17] So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 15:1‑11 ESV]

[1] "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 
[2] Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 
[3] Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. 
[4] Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. 
[5] I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 
[6] If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. 
[7] If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 
[8] By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. 
[9] As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. 
[10] If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. 
[11] These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."

## Sermon (largely copied from a sermon written by James Baneck, President, North Dakota District: *Into Your Hand I Commit My Spirit*. References can be found in his sermon document.)

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

Martin Luther is now 62 years old. This man, who achieved so much, is now growing tired and weak.
In November 1545, Luther finished his lectures on the book of Genesis and said, "I can do no more, for I am too weak."

Then there was an ongoing squabble among the three brothers who were leaders (or counts) in the city of Mansfeld---it all had to do with property and money and power.
On January 23, 1546, Luther set out for Mansfeld (just northwest of Eisleben) to mediate this family feud.
It was a cold German winter, and crossing the swollen icy Salle River was difficult.
On his way to Mansfeld, Luther suddenly became weak.
And yet, by mid-February, Luther had helped the counts come to an agreement, and peace was restored, but Luther felt weaker still.

On Monday, February 15, Luther preached at St. Andrew’s in Eisleben.
Luther ended his sermon rather abruptly, as he announced to the congregation, “This and much more might be said concerning this Gospel, but I am too weak and we shall let it go at that.”

Luther was taken to a home across the street where he rested for the next two days.
Around 8 P.M. on Wednesday, February 17, Luther went to the window and spoke his usual evening prayers.
Around 10 P.M., February 17, 1546, Luther went to bed and prayed Psalm 31:5,
**“Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O LORD , faithful God.”**

### 1. WHEN LUTHER DIED, A SCRAP OF PAPER WAS FOUND IN HIS POCKET ...

In his own handwriting, Luther wrote, “Let nobody suppose that he has tasted the Holy Scriptures sufficiently until he has ruled over the churches with the prophets for a hundred years.”
What he writes next gives us a profound insight into Luther’s faith and life.
He wrote, “Wir sind alle Pettler. Hoc est verum.”
These Latin and German words read, *“We are beggars. This is true.”*
Luther believed that without Jesus Christ, he was nothing.
He knew he had nothing to offer God---neither physically nor spiritually.

Especially Luther knew that, as a poor, miserable sinner before God, he was a poor, miserable beggar.
Isaiah 55:7 declares,

> **"Let the wicked forsake his way,**\
> **and the unrighteous man his thoughts;**\
> **let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him,**\
> **and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon."**

From his lectures on Isaiah 55:7, Luther writes, “The godly . . . always feel their own imperfection, and they always long for the grace of God. We sigh and pray for the remission of sins. . . . We sin much, and therefore we need much forgiveness.”
Isaiah 55:8 declares,

> **"For my thoughts are not your thoughts,**\
> **neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD."**

Again, on Isaiah 55:8, Luther confesses, “And I, Martin Luther, know that I am still feeble.”

As Luther went to bed that night feeling ill, and perhaps even suspecting that death was near, he admitted and confessed to God that he was a sinner, and as a believer in Jesus Christ, he was a *repentant* sinner at that, one who could only beg for God’s mercy.
Luther was prepared for death---for he was a beggar before God and Christ was His merciful Savior.

And, beloved in the Lord, you are a beggar too!
Before God, you bring nothing to the table---not now, not at your death.
Isaiah announces, **“All flesh is grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of the LORD blows on it; surely the people are grass”** (40:6‑7).
And so now, and at the time of your death, God calls you to repent, even as He says, **“Seek the LORD while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near ... return to the LORD , that He may have compassion on [you]”** (Isaiah 55:6‑7).

Luther went to bed that night in the sure confidence of Jesus Christ.
As a beggar before God, Luther closed his eyes in peace, knowing Isaiah’s words: **“Let [the wicked] return to the LORD, that He may have compassion on him, and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon”** (55:7).
Luther fell asleep for a few hours, content in being a beggar in God’s hands, for He knew his God has mercy on the repentant, that He is full of compassion and ready to pardon!
And you, too, O repentant beggar, beloved in the Lord, can rest in Christ, for He has compassion on you; He will abundantly pardon you, and in Him, you have peace.

### 2. AT 1 A.M., LUTHER SUDDENLY WOKE UP AND CRIED OUT, “O LORD GOD , I’M IN SO MUCH PAIN ! OH, DEAR DOCTOR JONAS, IT APPEARS AS THOUGH I SHALL REMAIN HERE!”

And then, that night, Luther recalled God’s Word of grace in this hour of death.
The Holy Spirit delivered these words to Luther’s mind, as he learned them by heart throughout the years.
These are words of God’s comfort, peace, and grace!

In his dying hour, Luther utters John 3:16,
**"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."**
Luther recites Psalm 68:20, **“Our God is a God of salvation, and to GOD , the Lord, belong deliverances from death.”**
Luther prays Luke 2:29, **“Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word.”**
And then Luther repeats three more times Psalm 31:5, **“Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O LORD , faithful God.”**

What would give Luther such confidence in his hour of death?
How could Luther be so bold with His judgment so near?
How could Luther be so certain that he could commit his spirit to the eternal Judge?
What gives *you* confidence and boldness in *your* hour of death before the eternal Judge?
For Luther, it was all about Jesus---it is because he believed that he was saved by grace through faith in Christ Jesus alone---as he was convinced through the Word of God!

Luther began his lectures on the Book of Romans in 1515.
The heart of these lectures may be summarized by Romans 10:10, **“For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.”**
In this portion of his lectures, Luther teaches this: “The apostle ... brings out the real kernel, teaching us with a strong argument that the entire Scripture deals only with Christ everywhere.”

Or perhaps Luther’s confidence is best stated in the First Article of his 1530 Smalcald Articles (which are part of of the Book of Concord), “The first and chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised for our justification (Romans 4:24‑25).
He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29), and God has laid upon Him the iniquities of us all (Isaiah 53:6). ... Upon this article everything that we teach and practice depends. ... Therefore, we must be certain and not doubt this doctrine.”

Perhaps, the night of his death, Luther recalled his lectures on Galatians: “[Christ] became a curse for us. ... [Christ] has and bears all the sins of all men in His body---not in the sense that He has committed them but in the sense that He took these sins, committed by us, upon His own body, in order to make satisfaction for them with His own blood.”
“Our sin must be Christ’s own sin, or we shall perish eternally.”
“And this is our highest comfort, to clothe and wrap Christ this way in my sins, your sins, and the sins of the entire world, and in this way to behold Him bearing all our sins.”
“By this fortunate exchange with us [Jesus] took upon Himself our sinful person and granted us His innocent and victorious Person.”
“This attachment to Him causes me to be liberated from the terror of the Law and of sin, pulled out of my own skin, and transferred into Christ and into His kingdom which is a kingdom of grace, righteousness, peace, joy, life, salvation, and eternal glory. Since I am in Him, no evil can harm me.”
(Luther would have done well to remember what he had written.)

Dear Christian, this is *your* Jesus; this is *your* God in your time of pain and distress, and even in your hour of death.
Jesus Christ has redeemed you with His own blood, death, and resurrection.
He paid the price for all the sins you have ever committed---the sins of your youth, the sins of your flesh, and the sins in your heart and mind.
His blood, death, and resurrection continually wash over you in your Baptism, as you are marked and sealed with Christ for the forgiveness of sins and the gift of eternal life.

The blood of Jesus Christ surges into your mouth, soul, and life in His own body and blood in His sacred Meal.
His holy flesh and blood forgives you all your sins, tears down the wall that separates you from God, and places eternal paradise into your flesh and soul.
This truth ... this comfort ... this gift of salvation ... this Jesus!---is yours now and when you close your eyes in earthly death.

### 3. THE NIGHT LUTHER DIED, HE PRAYED PSALM 31:5 FOUR TIMES, “INTO YOUR HAND I COMMIT MY SPIRIT; YOU HAVE REDEEMED ME, O LORD, FAITHFUL GOD.”

Justus Jonas knew Luther’s final moments had come. He asked his friend, “Reverend Father, will you remain steadfast in Christ and the doctrine which you have preached?”
Luther replied, “Yes!”
After countless lectures, hundreds of sermons, and thousands of pages of writing, the final word to come out of Luther was “Yes.”
Luther---this poor beggar---was ready to die, trusting in His dear Savior.
Luther died about three in the morning of a heart attack.
God delivered him out of this veil of tears.
Luther’s earthly journey was over.
One of Luther’s favorite portions of Scripture was John 15, which Luther understands as describing the Christian’s life in Christ.
Luther believed that Christ lives in and through the Christian.
Concerning John 15, Luther writes, “[Jesus] was sent into the world by the Father to redeem us from our sin by His suffering and death, and to reconcile us to the Father, that all who believe in Him might not be damned and lost but have remission of sin and eternal life for His sake.”

Hear what Luther preaches on this marvelous union with Christ: “Man is first declared clean by God’s Word for Christ’s sake, in whom he believes. For by such faith in the Word he is grafted into the Vine that is Christ and is clothed in His purity, which is imputed to him as his own and is as perfect and complete in him as it is in Christ.”

This, dear Christians, is indeed what takes place *[Point at the font.]* in *your* Baptism, and as you hear the preached Word, and as you eat and *[Point to the altar.]* drink Christ’s body and blood.
This is the Christian life---being grafted into the life-giving Vine and bearing much fruit.

And yet, in his sermon on John 15, Luther laments by saying, “But as it happens, most people live under the illusion that it is unnecessary to be and remain in Christ.”
So many fool themselves, thinking they can be Christian while living detached from the Vine.
They are not hearing God’s preached Word.
They are not receiving the blessed Sacrament.
Cut off from the Vine, there is no life---only death.

Attached to the Vine, however, is abundant and eternal life.
When we are attached to the Vine, *even in death*, Christ turns it into our good.
Luther announces, “Death and grave, be life!”
He continues, “[God] ... has a stronger and more forceful language and voice than the world and the devil.
He will outshout them and compel them to let us be with Christ and remain His true and fruitful Vine branches.”
And so, during our earthly life, Luther says, “We must see to it that we are always found in Christ, that is, that we hold to His Word and let nothing tear us away from it.”

### (CONCLUSION)

That morning, Luther’s body was taken to St. Andrew’s Church.
Justus Jonas preached that very morning.
Pastor Coelius preached the next morning.

Luther’s body was then draped with a white pall, and then with fifty horsemen, the 70‑mile journey to Wittenberg began.
The crowd grew to the thousands, and steeple bells rang from the churches.
Luther’s body arrived in Wittenberg.
He was taken to the Castle Church, where twenty‑nine years earlier he had nailed the Ninety‑Five Theses.
Luther was later buried there below the pulpit.

Luther’s pastor, Rev. Bugenhagen, preached the funeral sermon.
Bugenhagen expressed thanksgiving to God for Luther’s many gifts to the Church, for Luther’s valiant defense of the Gospel, and for the way in which Luther unlocked the Scriptures concerning Christ.
Most of all, Bugenhagen preached about Christ and how He has conquered death.
Bugenhagen proclaimed that, through Christ, the death of the body was merely the beginning of life eternal through Jesus Christ, who became the sacrifice for all [sinful beggars].

Beloved in the Lord, whether it be today or in our time of death---with Luther, we boldly confess our faith in Jesus Christ, **“Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O LORD , faithful God.”**
AMEN.
