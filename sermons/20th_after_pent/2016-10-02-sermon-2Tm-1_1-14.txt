## Old Testament [Hab 1:1‑4; 2:1‑4 ESV]

> [1] The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.\
> [2] O LORD, how long shall I cry for help,\
> and you will not hear?\
> Or cry to you “Violence!”\
> and you will not save?\
> [3] Why do you make me see iniquity,\
> and why do you idly look at wrong?\
> Destruction and violence are before me;\
> strife and contention arise.\
> [4] So the law is paralyzed,\
> and justice never goes forth.\
> For the wicked surround the righteous;\
> so justice goes forth perverted.
>
> [1] I will take my stand at my watchpost\
> and station myself on the tower,\
> and look out to see what he will say to me,\
> and what I will answer concerning my complaint.\
> [2] And the LORD answered me:\
> “Write the vision;\
> make it plain on tablets,\
> so he may run who reads it.\
> [3] For still the vision awaits its appointed time;\
> it hastens to the end—it will not lie.\
> If it seems slow, wait for it;\
> it will surely come; it will not delay.\
> [4] “Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,\
> but the righteous shall live by his faith.”

> [1] ΤΟ λῆμμα ὃ εἶδεν ᾿Αμβακοὺμ ὁ προφήτης.\
> [2] ῞Εως τίνος, Κύριε, κεκράξομαι καὶ οὐ μὴ εἰσακούσῃς;\
> βοήσομαι πρός σε ἀδικούμενος καὶ οὐ σώσεις;\
> [3] ἱνατί ἔδειξάς μοι κόπους καὶ πόνους,\
> ἐπιβλέπειν ταλαιπωρίαν καὶ ἀσέβειαν;\
> ἐξεναντίας μου γέγονε κρίσις,\
> καὶ ὁ κριτὴς λαμβάνει.\
> [4] διὰ τοῦτο διεσκέδασται νόμος,\
> καὶ οὐ διεξάγεται εἰς τέλος κρίμα,\
> ὅτι ὁ ἀσεβὴς καταδυναστεύει τὸν δίκαιον·\
> ἕνεκεν τούτου ἐξελεύσεται τὸ κρίμα διεστραμμένον.
>
> [1] ΕΠΙ τῆς φυλακῆς μου στήσομαι\
> καὶ ἐπιβήσομαι ἐπὶ πέτραν\
> καὶ ἀποσκοπεύσω τοῦ ἰδεῖν τί λαλήσει ἐν ἐμοὶ\
> καὶ τί ἀποκριθῶ ἐπὶ τὸν ἔλεγχόν μου.\
> [2] καὶ ἀπεκρίθη πρός με Κύριος καὶ εἶπε·\
> γράψον ὅρασιν καὶ σαφῶς εἰς πυξίον,\
> ὅπως διώκῃ ὁ ἀναγινώσκων αὐτά.\
> [3] διότι ἔτι ὅρασις εἰς καιρὸν\
> καὶ ἀνατελεῖ εἰς πέρας καὶ οὐκ εἰς κενόν·\
> ἐὰν ὑστερήσῃ, ὑπόμεινον αὐτόν,\
> ὅτι ἐρχόμενος ἥξει καὶ οὐ μὴ χρονίσῃ.\
> [4] ἐὰν ὑποστείληται, οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῷ·\
> ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεώς μου ζήσεται.

## Epistle [2Tm 1:1‑14 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus,

[2] To Timothy, my beloved child:

Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

[3] I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. [4] As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy. [5] I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well. [6] For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, [7] for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.

[8] Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God, [9] who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, [10] and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, [11] for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher, [12] which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me. [13] Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. [14] By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you.

[1] Παῦλος ἀπόστολος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ διὰ θελήματος θεοῦ κατ’ ἐπαγγελίαν ζωῆς τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ

[2] Τιμοθέῳ ἀγαπητῷ τέκνῳ,

χάρις ἔλεος εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν.

[3] Χάριν ἔχω τῷ θεῷ, ᾧ λατρεύω ἀπὸ προγόνων ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει, ὡς ἀδιάλειπτον ἔχω τὴν περὶ σοῦ μνείαν ἐν ταῖς δεήσεσίν μου νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας,
[4] ἐπιποθῶν σε ἰδεῖν, μεμνημένος σου τῶν δακρύων, ἵνα χαρᾶς πληρωθῶ,
[5] ὑπόμνησιν λαβὼν τῆς ἐν σοὶ ἀνυποκρίτου πίστεως, ἥτις ἐνῴκησεν πρῶτον ἐν τῇ μάμμῃ σου Λωΐδι καὶ τῇ μητρί σου Εὐνίκῃ, πέπεισμαι δὲ ὅτι καὶ ἐν σοί.
[6] Δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν ἀναμιμνῄσκω σε ἀναζωπυρεῖν τὸ χάρισμα τοῦ θεοῦ, ὅ ἐστιν ἐν σοὶ διὰ τῆς ἐπιθέσεως τῶν χειρῶν μου.
[7] οὐ γὰρ ἔδωκεν ἡμῖν ὁ θεὸς πνεῦμα δειλίας ἀλλὰ δυνάμεως καὶ ἀγάπης καὶ σωφρονισμοῦ.

8μὴ οὖν ἐπαισχυνθῇς τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν μηδὲ ἐμὲ τὸν δέσμιον αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ συγκακοπάθησον τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ κατὰ δύναμιν θεοῦ,
9τοῦ σώσαντος ἡμᾶς

> καὶ καλέσαντος κλήσει ἁγίᾳ,\
> οὐ κατὰ τὰ ἔργα ἡμῶν\
> ἀλλὰ κατὰ ἰδίαν πρόθεσιν καὶ χάριν,\
> τὴν δοθεῖσαν ἡμῖν ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ\
> πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων,

[10] φανερωθεῖσαν δὲ νῦν

> διὰ τῆς ἐπιφανείας τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ,\
> καταργήσαντος μὲν τὸν θάνατον\
> φωτίσαντος δὲ ζωὴν καὶ ἀφθαρσίαν διὰ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου

[11] εἰς ὃ ἐτέθην ἐγὼ κῆρυξ καὶ ἀπόστολος καὶ διδάσκαλος,
[12] δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν καὶ ταῦτα πάσχω· ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐπαισχύνομαι, οἶδα γὰρ ᾧ πεπίστευκα καὶ πέπεισμαι ὅτι δυνατός ἐστιν τὴν παραθήκην μου φυλάξαι εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν. 
[13] Ὑποτύπωσιν ἔχε ὑγιαινόντων λόγων ὧν παρ’ ἐμοῦ ἤκουσας ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ·
[14] τὴν καλὴν παραθήκην φύλαξον διὰ πνεύματος ἁγίου τοῦ ἐνοικοῦντος ἐν ἡμῖν.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 17:1‑10 ESV]

[1] And he said to his disciples, “Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! [2] It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. [3] Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, [4] and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”

[5] The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” [6] And the Lord said, “If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.

[7] “Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and recline at table’? [8] Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink’? [9] Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? [10] So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’”

[1] Εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ· ἀνένδεκτόν ἐστιν τοῦ τὰ σκάνδαλα μὴ ἐλθεῖν, πλὴν οὐαὶ δι’ οὗ ἔρχεται·
[2] λυσιτελεῖ αὐτῷ εἰ λίθος μυλικὸς περίκειται περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρριπται εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν ἢ ἵνα σκανδαλίσῃ τῶν μικρῶν τούτων ἕνα.
[3] προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς.
Ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐπιτίμησον αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐὰν μετανοήσῃ ἄφες αὐτῷ.
[4] καὶ ἐὰν ἑπτάκις τῆς ἡμέρας ἁμαρτήσῃ εἰς σὲ καὶ ἑπτάκις ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς σὲ λέγων· μετανοῶ, ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ.

[5] Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἀπόστολοι τῷ κυρίῳ· πρόσθες ἡμῖν πίστιν.
[6] εἶπεν δὲ ὁ κύριος· εἰ ἔχετε πίστιν ὡς κόκκον σινάπεως, ἐλέγετε ἂν τῇ συκαμίνῳ [ταύτῃ]· ἐκριζώθητι καὶ φυτεύθητι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ· καὶ ὑπήκουσεν ἂν ὑμῖν.

[7] Τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν δοῦλον ἔχων ἀροτριῶντα ἢ ποιμαίνοντα, ὃς εἰσελθόντι ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ· εὐθέως παρελθὼν ἀνάπεσε,
[8] ἀλλ’ οὐχὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ· ἑτοίμασον τί δειπνήσω καὶ περιζωσάμενος διακόνει μοι ἕως φάγω καὶ πίω, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ;
[9] μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα;
[10] οὕτως καὶ ὑμεῖς, ὅταν ποιήσητε πάντα τὰ διαταχθέντα ὑμῖν, λέγετε ὅτι δοῦλοι ἀχρεῖοί ἐσμεν, ὃ ὠφείλομεν ποιῆσαι πεποιήκαμεν.

## Introit [Ps 119:162, 164-165, 167; antiphon: Ps 119:166]

> I hope for your salvation, | O LORD,\*\
> and I do your com- | mandments.\
> I rejoice | at your word\*\
> like one who | finds great spoil.\
> Seven times a day I | praise you\*\
> for your just and righ- | teous decrees.\
> Great peace have those who | love your law;\*\
> nothing can make them | stumble.\
> My soul keeps your testi- | monies;\*\
> I love them ex- | ceedingly.


## Collect

O God, our refuge and strength, the author of all godliness, by Your grace hear the prayers of Your Church. Grant that those things which we ask in faith we may receive through Your bountiful mercy;
through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Notes

Hab 1:11. The Chaldeans' might is their god.

Hab 2:4. LXX says the righteous will live by *God's* faith.
This may be the faith that God has given to the believer;
perhaps in the sense that God has given faith to to the believer;
perhaps in the sense that God has given the believer something to believe in;
perhaps in the sense that God is the one who is faithful.

Hab 3:17‑18:

> Though the fig tree should not blossom,\
> nor fruit be on the vines,\
> the produce of the olive fail\
> and the fields yield no food,\
> the flock be cut off from the fold\
> and there be no herd in the stalls,\
> yet I will rejoice in the LORD;\
> I will take joy in the God of my salvation.

Jn 6:29. **Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”**
