## Old Testament [Is 45:1‑7 ESV]

> [1] Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus,\
> whose right hand I have grasped,\
> to subdue nations before him\
> and to loose the belts of kings,\
> to open doors before him\
> that gates may not be closed:\
> [2] “I will go before you\
> and level the exalted places,\
> I will break in pieces the doors of bronze\
> and cut through the bars of iron,\
> [3] I will give you the treasures of darkness\
> and the hoards in secret places,\
> that you may know that it is I, the LORD,\
> the God of Israel, who call you by your name.\
> [4] For the sake of my servant Jacob,\
> and Israel my chosen,\
> I call you by your name,\
> I name you, though you do not know me.\
> [5] I am the LORD, and there is no other,\
> besides me there is no God;\
> I equip you, though you do not know me,\
> [6] that people may know, from the rising of the sun\
> and from the west, that there is none besides me;\
> I am the LORD, and there is no other.\
> [7] I form light and create darkness;\
> I make well-being and create calamity;\
> I am the LORD, who does all these things.

## Epistle [1Th 1:1‑10 ESV]

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.

[1]  We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, 
[2]  remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
[3]  For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, 
[4]  because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. 
[5]  And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, 
[6]  so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
[7]  For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything. 
[8]  For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 
[9]  and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 22:15‑22 ESV; sermon text]

[15]  Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. 
[16]  And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.
[17]  Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
[18]  But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? 
[19]  Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius.
[20]  And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” 
[21]  They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” 
[22]  When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.

[15] Τότε πορευθέντες οἱ Φαρισαῖοι συμβούλιον ἔλαβον ὅπως αὐτὸν παγιδεύσωσιν ἐν λόγῳ. 
[16] καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν αὐτῷ τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν λέγοντες, Διδάσκαλε, οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀληθὴς εἶ καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ διδάσκεις, καὶ οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός, οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων. 
[17] εἰπὲ οὖν ἡμῖν τί σοι δοκεῖ: ἔξεστιν δοῦναι κῆνσον Καίσαρι ἢ οὔ; 
[18] γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς τὴν πονηρίαν αὐτῶν εἶπεν, Τί με πειράζετε, ὑποκριταί; 
[19] ἐπιδείξατέ μοι τὸ νόμισμα τοῦ κήνσου. οἱ δὲ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ δηνάριον. 
[20] καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς, Τίνος ἡ εἰκὼν αὕτη καὶ ἡ ἐπιγραφή; 
[21] λέγουσιν αὐτῷ, Καίσαρος. τότε λέγει αὐτοῖς, Ἀπόδοτε οὖν τὰ Καίσαρος Καίσαρι καὶ τὰ τοῦ θεοῦ τῷ θεῷ. 
[22] καὶ ἀκούσαντες ἐθαύμασαν, καὶ ἀφέντες αὐτὸν ἀπῆλθαν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
You may be aware of how tense a conversation is if one side, or maybe both, has an agenda.
Before a word is spoken, they already know what they want to say, and what they want you to hear, and what they want you to agree with before they even hear a single word from your lips.
In other words, you have nothing to say other than what they want to hear.
Things can only go one way, and if they do not, there is trouble.

A well-known example of a one-sided conversation happened during the Reformation, and which we studied in some detail in Wednesday Bible study; this example being Martin Luther at the Diet of Worms.
More than once I have been asked, "Pastor, what is the Diet of Worms?"
Well let me tell you.

A *diet*, in this case, is not a weight-loss program: it is an assembly of leaders.
A diet is an assembly of leaders who do not live and work in a capital city, like Washington D.C., but leaders who live and work in the territories that they rule.
For example, if there were no Congress in Washington D.C. and the governors had to meet to write and pass laws, then they would have to leave their states and meet every once in a while to make laws and decide to take action.
You could call their meeting a *diet*; that is what they were called in the days of the Reformation.
The Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, picked a place and said, "Let's meet face-to-face from January 28 to May 26 in Worms, Germany."
(And *Worms* is the name of a city.)
Yes, they met face-to-face for *five months* to have the time to work things out.

A Roman Catholic monk and professor of theology from the University of Wittenberg in Germany named Martin Luther was summoned to appear at the Diet of Worms on April 16, 1521 for something he had started three and a half years before, on October 31, 1517.
*In only nine days*, it will be exactly 500 years since that day: October 31, 1517.
On that day in 1517, Martin Luther tacked his Ninety‑Five Theses to the church door at Wittenberg.
As professor of theology, he had the right to post ideas for debate on the church door, which he did.
These ninety-five theses were entitled *Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences* which argued against the sale of indulgences---pieces of paper signed by the pope by which you could buy time off in purgatory.
The problem is that nowhere in the Bible is there mention of purgatory and nowhere in the Bible is there a command or even a mention of the sale of indulgences as an act of God to pay for sin.
The only act of God to pay for sin is the sacrificial death of Christ on the Cross!
Luther knew the sale of indulgences was a money-making scheme and he wanted to expose it not by looking at the money trail but by looking at God's revealed Word---to look at infallible truth and then judge the practice of selling indulgences.

The Roman Catholic Church still sells indulgences to this day.

The indulgence issue got hot and Martin Luther got to writing more than just the Ninety Five Theses.
In 1520, in the year before he appeared at the Diet of Worms, Luther published three papers:

The first paper is _An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility_.
This letter is written to political leaders---the princes of the regions who would meet at a diet.
In this paper, Luther describes the three walls of the Roman Church:

1. The first wall is the invention that popes, bishops, priests, and monks are the *spiritual estate* and that princes, lords, artisans, and farmers are the *temporal estate*. Luther calls these estates a fabrication and says that they are *all* spiritual estates---that a barrel maker or cobbler or prince is called by God to do his work just like a priest is---they are *all* holy callings as the Bible teaches in 1 Corinthians, chapter 12: **"To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good ... As it is, there are many parts, yet one body"** [(1Co 12:7, 20 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+12/)
2. The second wall is the claim that to the pope alone belongs the interpretation of the Bible or the confirmation of an interpretation of the Bible. *[Illustration]* I ran in to this once in college at a Roman Catholic Bible study. A friend invited me and I went. I participated in the discussion and made a point, I believe, from one of Paul's letters to Timothy. The problem was that the point conflicted with what was being taught. I forget what that point was, but I remember being told that the pope is the final interpreter of Scripture. Luther again quotes 1 Corinthians: **"The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one"** [(1Co 2:15 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+2/). Why then can a spiritual Christian not interpret the Bible while an unbelieving pope can?
3. And finally, the third wall is that only the pope alone can call a council---a meeting to discuss the teaching and practice of the Church and change it, if necessary. Luther wrote,

> "For when the pope acts contrary to the Scriptures, it is our duty to stand by the Scriptures, to reprove him, and to constrain him, according to the word of Christ in Matthew 18:15: **'If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother'** (ESV)."

All that Luther wanted was a church council, like the one the apostles had in Acts, chapter 15, to discuss and reform, if necessary, what was being taught and practiced in the Roman Catholic Church.
The only rule by which everything would be decided would be God's revealed Word: the Bible.

I had started saying that Luther wrote three papers in 1520, and I explained to you in outline what the first paper was. That paper was _An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility_.
The second paper is _The Babylonian Captivity of the Church_.
This paper criticized the Roman Catholic system of seven sacraments: (1) Baptism, Penance (Confession), the Eucharist (Holy Communion), Holy Orders, Marriage, Confirmation, and Last Rites.
Luther's criticism had to do with three of these seven: Baptism, Confession, and Holy Communion. They all benefit the Christian *by faith in the promise of forgiveness given with these three*.

* You are saved by Baptism because by Baptism Jesus washes away your sin.
* You are forgiven by the priest's absolution because his forgiveness is Christ's forgiveness. There is no reason to say ten *Hail Mary's* or make a pilgrimage or serve time in purgatory when Christ's forginess is complete.
* Jesus says of Holy Communion, **"Take, eat, this is My body, given for you. ... Drink of it, all of you, for this cup is the new testament in My blood, shed for you for the forgiveness of sins."**

Believe Christ's forgiveness and you have it! It is that simple.

The third paper is _Concerning Christian Liberty_; it is an open letter to the pope. In it Luther makes the point that Christians are forgiven and free from being compelled to keep the Ten Commandments.
It is because we have failed to keep that Commandments that Christ fulfilled the Commandments by taking our punishment of death on the Cross.
When Jesus says, **"If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed"** [(Jn 8:36 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+8/), you are free from the burden of having to keep God's Commandments to be saved.
Read Paul's letter to the Galatians: you are saved *completely* by faith alone.
Christ has set you free from *having* to be good: by believing in Him you *are* good and gladly do what pleases Him.

*[Humor]* Thank you for your indulgence, but there is even more to what led Martin Luther to appear at the Diet of Worms.
I am very grateful that God raised up such a man to proclaim God's Word---to underline it and publish it for everyone to know so that we can live in freedom under *Christ's Word* and not the teachings of man---so that we can live in the freedom of having been forgiven *completely* of our sins by *nothing* that we have done---for what could be certain about anything we have done?---but by *everything* Christ has done---His perfect obedience and innocent suffering and death in punishment for our sins---**"He was crushed for our iniquities"** (Is 53:5).

Luther appears at the Diet of Worms and he is shown a table of his writings, including _An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility_, including _The Babylonian Captivity of the Church_, including _Concerning Christian Liberty_, and instead of a discussion, the chair of the meeting asked him if he acknowledged that these books were his, and if he wished to confess his books or recant.
"Do you believe what you wrote or do you deny it? Answer this and that will be the end of the discussion."
Luther, after deliberating for a day, gave his famous answer: "I cannot and will not retract anything. ... Here I stand. God help me. Amen."

Beloved in the Lord, that is the long, Reformation version of a one sided conversation.
But who is Martin Luther compared to our Lord Jesus Christ in the Holy Gospel today.
You know that His enemies are the Pharisees---the pope and bishops of the day---but today they bring with them the Herodians---the princes and rulers of the day, and you get the idea that the setting for the Holy Gospel is not far from the Diet of Worms.
But like I said, who is Martin Luther but a grateful beggar before our Lord Jesus Christ?

The Pharisees and the Herodians wanted to catch Jesus in His Words that they could accuse him and probably put him in a Roman prison if they could get Him to say, "Don't pay your taxes to the Romans."
They couldn't.
Jesus may have given a smart answer when He pointed to the denarius with Caesar's inscription and said, **"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.*""

But who is Jesus?

Jesus wins when you think He's losing. This is a glorious thing in our eyes.

AMEN.

## Notes

Mt 22:16. The Pharisees team up with the Herodians. Who are the Herodians? The dynasty of Herod the Great and its political supporters. Descendants of Herod ruled the region of Israel on behalf of the Romans (63 BC-100 AD).[^1]
