## Old Testament [Gn 2:18-25 ESV]

[18] Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” [19] Now out 
of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see 
what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. [20]The man gave names to all 
livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.
[21] So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place 
with flesh. [22] And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. [23] Then
the man said,
“This at last is bone of my bones
    and flesh of my flesh;
she shall be called Woman,
    because she was taken out of Man.”
[24] Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. [25] 
And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.

## Epistle [Hebrews 2:1-18]
[2:1] Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. [2] For since the message 
declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, [3] how shall we 
escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,
[4] while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
[5] For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. [6] It has been testified somewhere,
“What is man, that you are mindful of him,
    or the son of man, that you care for him?
[7] You made him for a little while lower than the angels;
    you have crowned him with glory and honor,
[8]     putting everything in subjection under his feet.”
Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in
subjection to him. [9] But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
[10] For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder 
of their salvation perfect through suffering. [11] For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That 
is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, [12] saying,
“I will tell of your name to my brothers;
    in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.”
[13] And again,
“I will put my trust in him.”
And again,
“Behold, I and the children God has given me.”
[14] Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death 
he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, [15] and deliver all those who through fear of death 
were subject to lifelong slavery. [16] For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. 
[17] Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest
in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. [18] For because he himself has suffered when tempted, 
he is able to help those who are being tempted.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 10:2-16 ESV]

[2] And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” [3] He answered them, 
“What did Moses command you?” [4] They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.” 
[5] And Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. [6] But from the beginning of 
creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ [7] ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, 
[8] and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. [9] What therefore God has joined together, 
let not man separate.”
[10] And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. [11] And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and 
marries another commits adultery against her, [12] and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”
[13] And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. [14] But when Jesus saw it,
he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 
[15] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” [16] And he took them in
his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.

## Introit [Ps 127:3-5; antiphon: Ps 127:1a]

> Unless the LORD | builds the house,\*\
> those who build it la- | bor in vain.\
> Behold, children are a heritage| from the LORD,\*\
> the fruit of the womb | a reward.\
> Like arrows in the hand of a  | warrior\*\

> Blessed is the man who fills his quiver | with them!\*\
> He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies | in the gate.\
