## Old Testament [Gn 2:18-25 ESV]

[18] Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” [19] Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. [20] The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him. [21] So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. [22] And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. [23] Then the man said,

> “This at last is bone of my bones\
> and flesh of my flesh;\
> she shall be called Woman,\
> because she was taken out of Man.”

[24] Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. [25] And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.

## Epistle [Hebrews 2:1-18]

[1] Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
[2] For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, [3] how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,
[4] while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.

[5] For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. [6] It has been testified somewhere,

> “What is man, that you are mindful of him,\
> or the son of man, that you care for him?\
> [7] You made him for a little while lower than the angels;\
> you have crowned him with glory and honor,\
> [8] putting everything in subjection under his feet.”

Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. [9] But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.

[10] For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder 
of their salvation perfect through suffering. [11] For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That 
is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, [12] saying,

> “I will tell of your name to my brothers;\
> in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.”

[13] And again,

> “I will put my trust in him.”

And again,

> “Behold, I and the children God has given me.”

[14] Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, [15] and deliver all those who through fear of death 
were subject to lifelong slavery. [16] For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. [17] Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest
in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. [18] For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.

[1] Διὰ τοῦτο δεῖ περισσοτέρως προσέχειν ἡμᾶς τοῖς ἀκουσθεῖσιν, μήποτε παραρυῶμεν. 
[2] εἰ γὰρ ὁ δι' ἀγγέλων λαληθεὶς λόγος ἐγένετο βέβαιος, καὶ πᾶσα παράβασις καὶ παρακοὴ ἔλαβεν ἔνδικον μισθαποδοσίαν, 
[3] πῶς ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα τηλικαύτης ἀμελήσαντες σωτηρίας; ἥτις, ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα λαλεῖσθαι διὰ τοῦ κυρίου, ὑπὸ τῶν ἀκουσάντων εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐβεβαιώθη, 
[4] συνεπιμαρτυροῦντος τοῦ θεοῦ σημείοις τε καὶ τέρασιν καὶ ποικίλαις δυνάμεσιν καὶ πνεύματος ἁγίου μερισμοῖς κατὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ θέλησιν. 

[5] Οὐ γὰρ ἀγγέλοις ὑπέταξεν τὴν οἰκουμένην τὴν μέλλουσαν, περὶ ἧς λαλοῦμεν. 
[6] διεμαρτύρατο δέ πού τις λέγων,

> Τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος ὅτι μιμνῄσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν; 
[7] ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν βραχύ τι παρ' ἀγγέλους, δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφάνωσας αὐτόν, 
[8] πάντα ὑπέταξας ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ.

ἐν τῷ γὰρ ὑποτάξαι [αὐτῷ] τὰ πάντα οὐδὲν ἀφῆκεν αὐτῷ ἀνυπότακτον. νῦν δὲ οὔπω ὁρῶμεν αὐτῷ τὰ πάντα ὑποτεταγμένα: 
[9] τὸν δὲ βραχύ τι παρ' ἀγγέλους ἠλαττωμένον βλέπομεν Ἰησοῦν διὰ τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον, ὅπως χάριτι θεοῦ ὑπὲρ παντὸς γεύσηται θανάτου. 

[10] Ἔπρεπεν γὰρ αὐτῷ, δι' ὃν τὰ πάντα καὶ δι' οὗ τὰ πάντα, πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι. 
[11] ὁ τε γὰρ ἁγιάζων καὶ οἱ ἁγιαζόμενοι ἐξ ἑνὸς πάντες: δι' ἣν αἰτίαν οὐκ ἐπαισχύνεται ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοὺς καλεῖν, 
[12] λέγων,

> Ἀπαγγελῶ τὸ ὄνομά σου τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου, ἐν μέσῳ ἐκκλησίας ὑμνήσω σε: 

[13] καὶ πάλιν,

> Ἐγὼ ἔσομαι πεποιθὼς ἐπ' αὐτῷ:

καὶ πάλιν,

> Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ καὶ τὰ παιδία ἅ μοι ἔδωκεν ὁ θεός. 

[14] ἐπεὶ οὖν τὰ παιδία κεκοινώνηκεν αἵματος καὶ σαρκός, καὶ αὐτὸς παραπλησίως μετέσχεν τῶν αὐτῶν, ἵνα διὰ τοῦ θανάτου καταργήσῃ τὸν τὸ κράτος ἔχοντα τοῦ θανάτου, τοῦτ' ἔστιν τὸν διάβολον, 
[15] καὶ ἀπαλλάξῃ τούτους, ὅσοι φόβῳ θανάτου διὰ παντὸς τοῦ ζῆν ἔνοχοι ἦσαν δουλείας. 
[16] οὐ γὰρ δήπου ἀγγέλων ἐπιλαμβάνεται, ἀλλὰ σπέρματος Ἀβραὰμ ἐπιλαμβάνεται. 
[17] ὅθεν ὤφειλεν κατὰ πάντα τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ὁμοιωθῆναι, ἵνα ἐλεήμων γένηται καὶ πιστὸς ἀρχιερεὺς τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν, εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκεσθαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας τοῦ λαοῦ: 
[18] ἐν ᾧ γὰρ πέπονθεν αὐτὸς πειρασθείς, δύναται τοῖς πειραζομένοις βοηθῆσαι.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 10:2-16 ESV]

[2] And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” [3] He answered them, “What did Moses command you?” [4] They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.” [5] And Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. [6] But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ [7] ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, [8] and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. [9] What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”

[10] And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. [11] And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, [12] and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”

[13] And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. [14] But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 
[15] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” [16] And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.

## Introit [Ps 127:3-5; antiphon: Ps 127:1a]

> Unless the LORD | builds the house,\*\
> those who build it la- | bor in vain.\
> Behold, children are a heritage| from the LORD,\*\
> the fruit of the womb | a reward.\
> Like arrows in the hand of a  | warrior\*\
> are the children | of one's youth.\
> Blessed is the man who fills his quiver | with them!\*\
> He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies | in the gate.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
We all believe in angels and we now begin our Epistles lessons in the letter to the Hebrews, which of all the places in the Bible gives the most specific teaching on angels.
We will hear Epistle readings from Hebrews now for five Sundays---for Reformation Sunday our Epistle will be from Romans, chapter 3, of course and for All Saints our Epistle will be from 1 John, chapter 3.
Our last reading from Hebrews will be November 18, which is the Sunday before Thanksgiving.
I take it as the Lord's timing that we happen to be studying Hebrews at this time in adult Bible study.
Thank the Lord, then, for this opportunity to be immersed in Hebrews, and may the Spirit bless us richly to keep this Word in our hearts unto salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Our first reading is from Hebrews, chapter 2, but Hebrews, chapter 1, as we learned in Bible study, is nothing to gloss over, for in it we marvel at Christ, the Son of God, who is greater than the angels.
Hear now the very first verses of Hebrews, with which you are probably familiar:

> **Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.** ([Heb 1:1‑4](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1/) ESV)

Every Communion Sunday it is our practice to confess the Nicene Creed.
These words of the Nicene Creed are informed by the first verses of Hebrews:

> *[I believe] in one Lord Jesus Christ,*\
> *the only-begotten Son of God,*\
> *begotten of His Father before all worlds,*\
> *God of God, Light of Light,*\
> *very God of very God,*\
> *begotten, not made,*\
> *being of one substance with the Father,*\
> *by whom all things were made.*

For Hebrews, chapter 1 wonders at the Son having God's name---the name greater than the angels, greater than all creatures.
The Son is also the **exact imprint** of God's **nature**; the Nicene Creed articulates this as the Son being *once substance with the Father*.
It is a mystery at which not only do we marvel, but also the author of Hebrews.

Who is the author of Hebrews, anyway?
Some say St.~Paul, but hear this statement from our Episitle reading:
**"It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard."**
This message was declared by the Lord and then attested *to us*---to the writer and to others---*by those who heard*.
*By those who heard* certainly include the apostles, who were taught directly by Christ.
And of course the apostles were officially the ones sent by Christ to preach and teach Christ's Word.
The writer of Hebrews is certainly *not* one of the apostles, since he heard the message from the apostles.
Therefore, it does not seem possible that St.~Paul, an apostle taught directly by Christ ([Gal 1:1, 12](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+1/)), is the author of Hebrews.
Though an apostle did not write Hebrews, the author does record the apostles' message, and the message is about Jesus!

> **For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?**

The message declared by angels is the Ten Commandments given to Moses.
Reading Exodus, it does not explicitly say that angels gave the Commandments to Moses, but when St.~Stephen preaches his sermon in Acts, chapter 7, he does:

> **“This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’---this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.’ This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness _with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai_, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us. ... You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you _who received the law as delivered by angels_ and did not keep it.”** ([Ac 7:35‑38, 51‑53](https://www.esv.org/Acts+7:35/) ESV)

Thank you, Stephen!
But as you know, he was stoned for preaching this, but I hope you caught that the Law was the message given to Moses by angels, where every transgression and disobedience receives a just punishment.
Steal and you die.
Profane the Sabbath and you die.
Break any commandment and you are guilty and you die.
But how much greater a message we have with Christ!

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
