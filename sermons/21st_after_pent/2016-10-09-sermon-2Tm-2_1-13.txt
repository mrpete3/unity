## Old Testament [Ruth 1:1‑19a ESV]

[1] In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. [2] The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. [3] But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. [4] These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years, [5] and both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.

[6] Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the LORD had visited his people and given them food. [7] So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. [8] But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. [9] The LORD grant that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband!” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. [10] And they said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.” [11] But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? [12] Turn back, my daughters; go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons, [13] would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.” [14] Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.

[15] And she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” [16] But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. [17] Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.” [18] And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.

[19] So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem.

[1]  ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ κρίνειν τοὺς κριτὰς καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ Βηθλεὲμ τῆς ᾿Ιούδα τοῦ παροικῆσαι ἐν ἀγρῷ Μωάβ, αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ. 
[2]  καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀνδρὶ ᾿Ελιμέλεχ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ Νεωμίν, καὶ ὄνομα τοῖς δυσὶν υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ Μααλὼν καὶ Χελαιών, ᾿Εφραθαῖοι ἐκ Βηθλεὲμ τῆς ᾿Ιούδα· καὶ ἤλθοσαν εἰς ἀγρὸν Μωὰβ καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ. 
[3]  και ἀπέθανεν ᾿Ελιμέλεχ ὁ ἀνὴρ τῆς Νεωμίν, καὶ κατελείφθη αὕτη καὶ οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτῆς. 
[4]  καὶ ἐλάβοσαν ἑαυτοῖς γυναῖκας Μωαβίτιδας, ὄνομα τῇ μιᾷ ᾿Ορφά, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ δευτέρᾳ Ρούθ· καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ ὡς δέκα ἔτη. 
[5]  καὶ ἀπέθανον καί γε ἀμφότεροι, Μααλὼν καὶ Χελαιών, καὶ κατελείφθη ἡ γυνὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν δύο υἱῶν αὐτῆς. 

[6]  καὶ ἀνέστη αὕτη καὶ αἱ δύο νύμφαι αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν ἐξ ἀγροῦ Μωάβ, ὅτι ἤκουσεν ἐν ἀγρῷ Μωὰβ ὅτι ἐπέσκεπται Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς ἄρτους, 
[7]  καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου, οὗ ἦν ἐκεῖ, καὶ αἱ δύο νύμφαι αὐτῆς μετ᾿ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐπορεύοντο ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι εἰς τὴν γῆν ᾿Ιούδα. 
[8]  καὶ εἶπε Νωεμὶν ταῖς δυσὶ νύμφαις αὐτῆς· πορεύεσθαι δή, ἀποστράφητε ἑκάστη εἰς οἶκον μητρὸς αὐτῆς· ποιήσαι Κύριος μετ᾿ ὑμῶν ἔλεος, καθὼς ἐποιήσατε μετὰ τῶν τεθνηκόταν καὶ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ· 
[9]  δῴη Κύριος ὑμῖν καὶ εὕροιτε ἀνάπαυσιν ἑκάστη ἐν οἴκῳ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς· καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτάς, καὶ ἐπῇραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν. 
[10]  καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ· μετὰ σοῦ ἐπιστρέφομεν εἰς τὸν λαόν σου. 
[11]  καὶ εἶπε Νωεμίν· ἐπιστράφητε δή, θυγατέρες μου· καὶ ἱνατί πορεύεσθε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ; μὴ ἔτι μοι υἱοὶ ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ μου καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς ἄνδρας; 
[12]  ἐπιστράφητε δή, θυγατέρες μου, διότι γεγήρακα τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἀνδρί· ὅτι εἶπα, ὅτι ἔστι μοι ὑπόστασις τοῦ γενηθῆναί με ἀνδρὶ καὶ τέξομαι υἱούς, 
[13]  μὴ αὐτοὺς προσδέξεσθαι ἕως οὗ ἁδρυνθῶσιν; ἢ αὐτοῖς κατασχεθήσεσθε τοῦ μὴ γενέσθαι ἀνδρί; μὴ δή, θυγατέρες μου, ὅτι ἐπικράνθη μοι ὑπὲρ ὑμᾶς, ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν ἐν ἐμοὶ χεὶρ Κυρίου. 
[14]  καὶ ἐπῇραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἔτι· καὶ κατεφίλησεν ᾿Ορφὰ τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτῆς, Ροὺθ δὲ ἠκολούθησεν αὐτῇ. 

[15]  καὶ εἶπε Νωεμὶν πρὸς Ρούθ· ἰδοὺ ἀνέστρεψεν ἡ σύννυμφός σου πρὸς λαὸν αὐτῆς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῆς· ἐπιστράφηθι δὴ καὶ σὺ ὀπίσω τῆς συννύμφου σου. 
[16]  εἶπε δὲ Ρούθ· μὴ ἀπάντησαί μοι τοῦ καταλιπεῖν σε ἢ ἀποστρέψαι ὄπισθέν σου· ὅτι σὺ ὅπου ἐὰν πορευθῇς, πορεύσομαι, καὶ οὗ ἐὰν αὐλισθῇς, αὐλισθήσομαι· ὁ λαός σου λαός μου, καὶ ὁ Θεός σου Θεός μου· 
[17]  καὶ οὗ ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃς, ἀποθανοῦμαι, κἀκεῖ ταφήσομαι· τάδε ποιήσαι μοι Κύριος καὶ τάδε προσθείῃ, ὅτι θάνατος διαστελεῖ ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ. 
[18]  ἰδοῦσα δὲ Νωεμὶν ὅτι κραταιοῦται αὐτὴ τοῦ πορεύεσθαι μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, ἐκόπασε τοῦ λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτὴν ἔτι. 

[19]  ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ ἀμφότεραι, ἕως τοῦ παραγενέσθαι αὐτὰς εἰς Βηθλεέμ.

## Epistle [2Tm 2:1‑13 ESV; sermon text]

[1] You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, [2] and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. [3] Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. [4] No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. [5] An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. [6] It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. [7] Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.

[8] Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, [9] for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound! [10] Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. [11] The saying is trustworthy, for:

> If we have died with him, we will also live with him;\
> [12] if we endure, we will also reign with him;\
> if we deny him, he also will deny us;\
> [13] if we are faithless, he remains faithful—
	
for he cannot deny himself.

[1] Σὺ οὖν, τέκνον μου, ἐνδυναμοῦ ἐν τῇ χάριτι τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ,
[2] καὶ ἃ ἤκουσας παρ’ ἐμοῦ διὰ πολλῶν μαρτύρων, ταῦτα παράθου πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις, οἵτινες ἱκανοὶ ἔσονται καὶ ἑτέρους διδάξαι.
[3] Συγκακοπάθησον ὡς καλὸς στρατιώτης Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ.
[4] οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματείαις, ἵνα τῷ στρατολογήσαντι ἀρέσῃ.
[5] ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ.
[6] τὸν κοπιῶντα γεωργὸν δεῖ πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν.
[7] νόει ὃ λέγω· δώσει γάρ σοι ὁ κύριος σύνεσιν ἐν πᾶσιν.

[8] Μνημόνευε Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν, ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυίδ, κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου,
[9] ἐν ᾧ κακοπαθῶ μέχρι δεσμῶν ὡς κακοῦργος, ἀλλ’ ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται·
[10] διὰ τοῦτο πάντα ὑπομένω διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς, ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ μετὰ δόξης αἰωνίου.
[11] πιστὸς ὁ λόγος·

> εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν, καὶ συζήσομεν·\
> [12] εἰ ὑπομένομεν, καὶ συμβασιλεύσομεν·\
> εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα, κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς·\
> [13]εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν, ἐκεῖνος πιστὸς μένει,\
> ἀρνήσασθαι γὰρ ἑαυτὸν οὐ δύναται.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 17:11‑19 ESV]

[11] On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. [12] And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance [13] and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” [14] When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed. [15] Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; [16] and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. [17] Then Jesus answered, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? [18] Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?”
[19] And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.”

[11] Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ αὐτὸς διήρχετο διὰ μέσον Σαμαρείας καὶ Γαλιλαίας.
[12] Καὶ εἰσερχομένου αὐτοῦ εἴς τινα κώμην ἀπήντησαν [αὐτῷ] δέκα λεπροὶ ἄνδρες, οἳ ἔστησαν πόρρωθεν
[13] καὶ αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνὴν λέγοντες· Ἰησοῦ ἐπιστάτα, ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς.
[14] καὶ ἰδὼν εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· πορευθέντες ἐπιδείξατε ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν. καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ὑπάγειν αὐτοὺς ἐκαθαρίσθησαν. 
[15] Εἷς δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν, ἰδὼν ὅτι ἰάθη, ὑπέστρεψεν μετὰ φωνῆς μεγάλης δοξάζων τὸν θεόν,
[16] καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον παρὰ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ εὐχαριστῶν αὐτῷ· καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν Σαμαρίτης.
[17] ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν· οὐχὶ οἱ δέκα ἐκαθαρίσθησαν; οἱ δὲ ἐννέα ποῦ;
[18] οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες δοῦναι δόξαν τῷ θεῷ εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος;
[19] καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἀναστὰς πορεύου· ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε.
