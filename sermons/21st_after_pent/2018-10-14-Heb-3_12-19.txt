## Old Testament [Amos. 5:6-7, 10-15 ESV]

> [6] Seek the Lord and live,\
> lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,\
> and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,\
> [7] O you who turn justice to wormwood\
> and cast down righteousness to the earth!\
> [10] They hate him who reproves in the gate,\
> and they abhor him who speaks the truth.\
> [11] Therefore because you trample on the poor\
> and you exact taxes of grain from him,\
> you have built houses of hewn stone,\
> but you shall not dwell in them;\
> you have planted pleasant vineyards,\
> but you shall not drink their wine.\
> [12] For I know how many are your transgressions\
> and how great are your sins—\
> you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe,\
> and turn aside the needy in the gate.\
> [13] Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time,\
> for it is an evil time.\
> [14] Seek good, and not evil,\
> that you may live;\
> and so the Lord, the God of hosts, will be with you,\
> as you have said.\
> [15] Hate evil, and love good,\
> and establish justice in the gate;\
> it may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,\
> will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.\


## Epistle [Heb. 3:12-19 ESV; sermon text]

[12] Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. [13] But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. [14] For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.
[15] As it is said, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
[16] For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? [17] And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? [18] And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? [19] So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 10:17-22 ESV]

[17] And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do 
to inherit eternal life?” [18] And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. [19] You know 
the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your 
father and mother.’” [20] And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.” [21] And Jesus, looking at him, 
loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in 
heaven; and come, follow me.” [22] Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.

## Introit [Ps 112:3-6; antiphon: Ps 112:1]

> Praise the LORD! Blessed is the man who | fears the LORD,\*\
> who greatly delights in his com- | mandments!\
> Wealth and riches are | in his house,\*\
> and his righteousness endures for- | ever.\
> Light dawns in the darkness for the | upright;\*\
> he is gracious, merciful, and | righteous.\
> It is well with the man who deals generous- | ly and lends;\*\
> who conducts his affairs with | justice.\
> For the righteous will nev- | er be moved;\*\
> he will be remembered for- | ever.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
We continue to hear what the Holy Spirit has to say to us through the inspired writer of Hebrews.
I thank our adult Bible study members for nominating and then voting for Hebrews to be book of the Bible we are now studying, for it coincides perfectly with the Epistle readings at this time.
Do you think that when things are worked out better than you could have planned that it is the Lord's hand?
I usually believe that---when something is better than I could have planned or imagined, I praise God, for I do not take it as a coincidence but as a blessing from the hand of God.
And by the way, when  something is *worse* than I could have planned or *worse* than I could have imagined, I have also learned to praise God, for I can see that this was the case with Job.
God works in mysterious ways, and some of the ways seem terrible.

But today, beloved in the Lord, is not terrible, for all is in alignment.
Even the Old Testament reading from Amos, chapter 5 is an exhoration to live in the fear of God.
*The fear of God* is a tricky expression, for it can be taken to mean nothing more that you should be afraid of God, and how can you possibly love Him?
**"I worship God and I'm afraid of Him"** is not a good summary of the Christian faith, so let us be careful to know and clearly articulate what *the fear of God* really is.
Look no further than God's own Word to get the answer, for Proverbs 8:28 states, **"The fear of the LORD is the hatred of evil"** ([Prv 8:13](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+8:13/) ESV).
And so, we hear from the mouth of the prophet Amos:

> **Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time,**\
> **for it is an evil time.**\
> **Seek good, and not evil,**\
> **that you may live;**\
> **and so the Lord, the God of hosts, will be with you,**\
> **as you have said.**\
> **Hate evil, and love good,**\
> **and establish justice in the gate;**\
> **it may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,**\
> **will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.** ([Am 5:13‑15](https://www.esv.org/Amos+5:13/) ESV)

This is an exhoration, which emphatically applies living as Christians today in this place and in this world, to lead God-fearing lives.
**Hate evil, and love good!**
Be careful about what you say and how you say it, what you do and how you do it, for the devil is stirring the pot of evil and looking for ingredients to add to the pot.
You do not want to be involved in that!
Do not be one of the devil's ingredients.
He will try to get you to say things and do things that make his pot more potent.
He will wait until you are angry.
He will wait until you are hungry.
He will wait until you really feel like you really need to feel in a certain way.
Then he will present you with something to think, he will present you with something to say, he will present you with something to do that seems right but is pure evil.
You do not want to be involved in that!
The devil is dragging the world down and he wants to drag you down with it.
Beware, and do not be involved in what the devil is doing.
Live as a God-fearing Christian---as a light and salt in this world.

Our Epistle reading continues with this theme:

> **Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.**

Do not grieve the Holy Spirit and let your evil and unbelieving heart take over.
You were given a new heart by the Spirit.
Pray for the Holy Spirit so you keep your new heart of flesh ([Lk 11:13](https://www.esv.org/Luke+11:13/))!
Away with the heart of stone!
And here is what we can do for each other as a church family: exhort each other not to be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
This is *real*: sin is tricky.
When we see sin we can bless each other by warning each other, "Don't get involved in that, it's sin!"
Thank *you*, if you should ever warn *me*, "Don't get involved in that, pastor, you'll sin, or you may get someone else to sin."
Beloved in the Lord, take this to heart: you say you are a Christian and guess what?
Now others are watching---your family, your church family, and unbelievers.
They are watching you to see if what you believe is what you do.
What an honor to bear Christ's name on the stage of everyday life, but what a serious thing it is, too!

Remember who you once were!
Satan got you to climb a mountain of sin.
"See? What a view it is to be on this mountain of sin."
And he was standing behind you getting ready to push you off the cliff.
He wanted to push you off the cliff and you would have fallen into the open jaws of hell *had Christ not rescued you from that mountain of sin*.
Jesus is Seal Team Six who comes from eternity to save you from being stuck on that cliff with the devil---He comes to save you from sin, death, devil, and hell.
Beloved in the Lord, do you really want Satan to lead you back up that mountain?
Seriously.
No!
You know it is really a pit of hell---the devil makes it *look* like a lovely mountain.
**Do not be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.**
One Christian guided by the Spirit can make any situation better,
not only for himself or herself, but for who are around him by warning about sin.

And forget not now how Jesus saved you.
He was **tempted as we are, yet without sin** ([Heb 4:15](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+4:15/)).
But though He was without sin, after praying in the Garden of Gethesemane that His Father would remove the cup of wrath from Him ([Lk 22:42](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22:42/)), He willingly went into the worst of all mocking and beating and being put to death that there ever was.
This was worse than what you or I could plan or imagine---but it was God's plan of letting Satan go only so far to inflict evil and punishment on His Son---it was God's plan to force Satan to loose his grip on us---the Father's sinless Son gladly took our sins upon Himself so He could handle them for us.
Beloved in the Lord, your sins and mine are more than we can handle.
Behold Jesus, who handled our sins for us so that we now stand forgiven by His blood shed on the Cross!

Keep Christ as your treasure, keep Christ as your laser focus, keep Christ as your confidence and you *cannot* be overcome by the deceifulness of sin.
Listen to your Good Shepherd's voice.
When?

> **“Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”**

And here we have the warning of who *not* to take as an example of Christian living.
Do not be the Israelites who hardened their hearts against God and against Moses in the wilderness.
God had led them through the Red Sea on dry ground and what did they do?
They grumbled,

> **The people thirsted [at Rephidim] for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”** ([Ex 17:3](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+17:3/) ESV)

That was a sin.
Though God gave them water from the rock to drink through the staff in Moses' hand, we are warned not to be like them.
Do not question, **"Is the LORD among us or not?"** ([Ex 17:7](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+17:7/))
He is where He says He will be.

> **"Where two or three are gathered in My name."** *[Point to congregation]* Jesus is here.

> **"Take and eat, this is My body given for you. ... Take and drink, this cup is the new testament in My blood, shed for the forgiveness of sins."** *[Point to altar]* Jesus is here.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
