## Old Testament [Amos. 5:6-7, 10-15 ESV]

> [6] Seek the Lord and live,\
> lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,\
> and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,\
> [7] O you who turn justice to wormwood\
> and cast down righteousness to the earth!\
> [10] They hate him who reproves in the gate,\
> and they abhor him who speaks the truth.\
> [11] Therefore because you trample on the poor\
> and you exact taxes of grain from him,\
> you have built houses of hewn stone,\
> but you shall not dwell in them;\
> you have planted pleasant vineyards,\
> but you shall not drink their wine.\
> [12] For I know how many are your transgressions\
> and how great are your sins—\
> you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe,\
> and turn aside the needy in the gate.\
> [13] Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time,\
> for it is an evil time.\
> [14] Seek good, and not evil,\
> that you may live;\
> and so the Lord, the God of hosts, will be with you,\
> as you have said.\
> [15] Hate evil, and love good,\
> and establish justice in the gate;\
> it may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,\
> will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.\


## Epistle [Heb. 3:12-19 ESV; sermon text]

[12] Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. 
[13] But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness 
of sin. [14] For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. [15] As it is said,
“Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
[16] For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? [17] And with whom was he 
provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? [18] And to whom did he swear 
that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? [19] So we see that they were unable to enter because of 
unbelief.

[13] Τίς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπ

## Holy Gospel [Mk 10:17-22 ESV]

[17] And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do 
to inherit eternal life?” [18] And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. [19] You know 
the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your 
father and mother.’” [20] And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.” [21] And Jesus, looking at him, 
loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in 
heaven; and come, follow me.” [22] Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.

## Introit [Ps 112:3-6; antiphon: Ps 112:1]

> Praise the LORD! Blessed is the man who | fears the LORD,\*\
> who greatly delights in his com- | mandments!\
> Wealth and riches are | in his house,\*\
> and his righteousness endures for- | ever.\
> Light dawns in the darkness for the | upright;\*\
> he is gracious, merciful, and | righteous.\
> It is well with the man who deals generous- | ly and lends;\*\
> who conducts his affairs with | justice.\
> For the righteous will nev- | er be moved;\*\
> he will be remembered for- | ever.\

## Notes

Jas 3:41. ἐριθείαν, according to greekbible.com, is "electioneering or intriguing for office." Theologically, it is to put oneself forward.
