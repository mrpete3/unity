## Old Testament [Gn 32:22‑30 ESV]

[22] The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. [23] He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had. [24] And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. [25] When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. [26] Then he said, “Let me go, for the day has broken.” But Jacob said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” [27] And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” [28] Then he said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.” [29] Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” But he said, “Why is it that you ask my name?” And there he blessed him. [30] So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, “For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.”

[22]  ᾿Αναστὰς δὲ τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην ἔλαβε τὰς δύο γυναῖκας καὶ τὰς δύο παιδίσκας καὶ τὰ ἕνδεκα παιδία αὐτοῦ καὶ διέβη τὴν διάβασιν τοῦ ᾿Ιαβώκ· 
[23]  καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτοὺς καὶ διέβη τὸν χειμάρρουν καὶ διεβίβασε πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ. 
[24]  ὑπελείφθη δὲ ᾿Ιακὼβ μόνος, καὶ ἐπάλαιεν ἄνθρωπος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωΐ. 
[25]  εἶδε δέ, ὅτι οὐ δύναται πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἥψατο τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνάρκησε τὸ πλάτος τοῦ μηροῦ ᾿Ιακὼβ ἐν τῷ παλαίειν αὐτὸν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. 
[26]  καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἀπόστειλόν με· ἀνέβη γὰρ ὁ ὄρθρος. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· οὐ μή σε ἀποστείλω, ἐὰν μή με εὐλογήσῃς. 
[27]  εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ· τί τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐστίν, ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ᾿Ιακώβ. 
[28]  καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· οὐ κληθήσεται ἔτι τὸ ὄνομά σου ᾿Ιακώβ, ἀλλ᾿ ᾿Ισραὴλ ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά σου, ὅτι ἐνίσχυσας μετὰ Θεοῦ, καὶ μετ᾿ ἀνθρώπων δυνατὸς ἔσῃ. 
[29]  ἠρώτησε δὲ ᾿Ιακὼβ καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάγγειλόν μοι τὸ ὄνομά σου. καὶ εἶπεν· ἱνατί τοῦτο ἐρωτᾶς σὺ τὸ ὄνομά μου; καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ. 
[30]  καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ᾿Ιακὼβ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, Εἶδος Θεοῦ· εἶδον γὰρ Θεὸν πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον, καὶ ἐσώθη μου ἡ ψυχή.

## Epistle [2Tm 3:14‑4:5 ESV; sermon text]

[14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it [15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. [16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, [17] that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

[4:1] I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: [2] preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. [3] For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, [4] and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. [5] As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

[14] Σὺ δὲ μένε ἐν οἷς ἔμαθες καὶ ἐπιστώθης, εἰδὼς παρὰ τίνων ἔμαθες,
[15] καὶ ὅτι ἀπὸ βρέφους [τὰ] ἱερὰ γράμματα οἶδας, τὰ δυνάμενά σε σοφίσαι εἰς σωτηρίαν διὰ πίστεως τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ.
[16] πᾶσα γραφὴ θεόπνευστος καὶ ὠφέλιμος πρὸς διδασκαλίαν, πρὸς ἐλεγμόν, πρὸς ἐπανόρθωσιν, πρὸς παιδείαν τὴν ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ,
[17] ἵνα ἄρτιος ᾖ ὁ τοῦ θεοῦ ἄνθρωπος, πρὸς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἐξηρτισμένος.

[4:1] Διαμαρτύρομαι ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ μέλλοντος κρίνειν ζῶντας καὶ νεκρούς, καὶ τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ·
[2] κήρυξον τὸν λόγον, ἐπίστηθι εὐκαίρως ἀκαίρως, ἔλεγξον, ἐπιτίμησον, παρακάλεσον, ἐν πάσῃ μακροθυμίᾳ καὶ διδαχῇ. 
[3] Ἔσται γὰρ καιρὸς ὅτε τῆς ὑγιαινούσης διδασκαλίας οὐκ ἀνέξονται ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὰς ἰδίας ἐπιθυμίας ἑαυτοῖς ἐπισωρεύσουσιν διδασκάλους κνηθόμενοι τὴν ἀκοὴν
[4] καὶ ἀπὸ μὲν τῆς ἀληθείας τὴν ἀκοὴν ἀποστρέψουσιν, ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς μύθους ἐκτραπήσονται. 
[5] Σὺ δὲ νῆφε ἐν πᾶσιν, κακοπάθησον, ἔργον ποίησον εὐαγγελιστοῦ, τὴν διακονίαν σου πληροφόρησον.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 18:1‑8 ESV]

[1] And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. [2] He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. [3] And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ [4] For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, [5] yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’” [6] And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says. [7] And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? [8] I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”

[1] Ἔλεγεν δὲ παραβολὴν αὐτοῖς πρὸς τὸ δεῖν πάντοτε προσεύχεσθαι αὐτοὺς καὶ μὴ ἐγκακεῖν,
[2] λέγων· κριτής τις ἦν ἔν τινι πόλει τὸν θεὸν μὴ φοβούμενος καὶ ἄνθρωπον μὴ ἐντρεπόμενος.
[3] χήρα δὲ ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ καὶ ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγουσα· ἐκδίκησόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου.
[4] καὶ οὐκ ἤθελεν ἐπὶ χρόνον. μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα εἶπεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ· εἰ καὶ τὸν θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι,
[5] διά γε τὸ παρέχειν μοι κόπον τὴν χήραν ταύτην ἐκδικήσω αὐτήν, ἵνα μὴ εἰς τέλος ἐρχομένη ὑπωπιάζῃ με.
[6] Εἶπεν δὲ ὁ κύριος· ἀκούσατε τί ὁ κριτὴς τῆς ἀδικίας λέγει·
[7] ὁ δὲ θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ τῶν βοώντων αὐτῷ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός, καὶ μακροθυμεῖ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς;
[8] λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ποιήσει τὴν ἐκδίκησιν αὐτῶν ἐν τάχει. πλὴν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν ἆρα εὑρήσει τὴν πίστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς;

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we have finally, in our Epistle reading today, come upon an extremely important verse of the Bible with which many of you are familiar: **"All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness."**
In other words, we have in the Bible the *very Word of God*.
This is not man's opinion---the Bible is *God's Word*.
I you were to train to do right, look to the Bible.
If you were wrong and needed correction, look to the Bible.
If you would need instruction about who you are and who God is and what He has done for your, look to the Bible.
You will find it there.

But before this verse and before our Epistle reading to day in 2 Timothy, chapter 3, we have the setting.
Allow me, please, to share with you the setting---the context---in which St Paul *[Hold up Bible]* holds up the Bible and says, "This is the breathed-out Word of God. Cling to it!"
Our setting comes from the beginning of 2&nbsp;Timothy, chapter&nbsp;3:

> **But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, ...** [(2Tm&nbsp;3:1&#x2011;2 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Timothy%203%3A1-2/)

"Wait a minute," you say. "This trouble is going on right now *today*!"
Yes, it is; at least I think so.
This list of trouble, this litany of the fruits of the flesh, is what *you* see on a day-by-day basis and St&nbsp;Paul saw 2,000&nbsp;years ago as happening in the last days.
**"Lovers of money, proud, and arrogant"** is in full flower today, and it was foretold in the Bible 2,000&nbsp;years ago.
Think back to 2,000&nbsp;years before that when God told Abram,

> **“Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, ... *and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed*.”** [(Gn&nbsp;12:1&#x2011;3 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2012%3A1-3/)

It took 2,000&nbsp;years of human history to pass before all the families of the earth *were* blessed by the person and work of Jesus Christ, just as the Spirit-inspired writer Moses recorded in the Bible.
Since the time of the apostle Paul, 2,000&nbsp;years of human history have passed again, and what Paul foretold is standing right in front of our faces today:

> **But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive,** (Let us continue.) **disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power.** [(2Tm&nbsp;3:1&#x2011;5 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Timothy%203%3A1-5/)

Beloved in the Lord, Paul is warning Timothy, but he is also warning you: watch out for these kinds of people!
Paul says, **"Avoid such people."**
You do not have to save them: give your clear testimony of Christ by what you think, say, and do, and then *stay away* from these treacherous people.
I do not even have to give you any examples because I am guessing that you already have some in your mind.
Avoid them! Stay away from them!

Now with regard to **having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power**, remember that Satan can only get close to you if he disguises himself as an angel of light [(2Co&nbsp;11:14)](http://www.esvbible.org/2+Corinthians+11:14/).
He does not come to you looking like the Creature from the Black Lagoon: he comes to you as a sheep. He will make false teachers appear to be godly, but they will lack the power of God.
What is the power of God?
Beloved in the Lord, *turn to the Bible*.
What does the Bible say are the fruits of the Spirit so that you will know when the power of God is lacking?
You learned it in Vacation Bible School:
**love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control** (Gal&nbsp;5:22&#x2011;23).

And what does Jesus say, again in the *Bible*, about fruits?

> **&ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.&rdquo;** [(Mt&nbsp;7:15&#x2011;20 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%207%3A15-20/)

Beloved in the Lord, is that clear?
False prophets and deceit threaten our faith and salvation in Jesus Christ.
Where to we turn for guidance? Where to we turn for truth? Where to we turn for comfort?
We turn to the very words of the Bible.
Beloved in the Lord, do you see the value of the Bible?

> **All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work** and defended from satanic deception.

St&nbsp;Paul warns the pastor Timothy, **&ldquo;The time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.&rdquo;**
Beloved in the Lord, Satan, in these last days, is crafting false teachers---false teachers designed to scratch your itching ears.
Is there a way you particularly like to be itched?
Are there words you love to hear over and over and over again so that you do not even check against the Bible whether it is true or not?
Those are the words Satan is putting into the mouths of the false prophets, who have been sent to itch your ears and draw you away from Christ.

Timothy's charge, and mine as your pastor, is simple: **&ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.&rdquo;**
The Word is the God-breathed words of the Bible; the Word made flesh is our Lord Jesus Himself.
Preach Him and Him alone as the one who has saved us from the devil's domain of darkness and brought us into His kingdom of light by the forgiveness of our sins. AMEN.

1Tm 1:6‑7. False teachers claim to teach God's Word but know nothing about it. They drag others into vain discussions.
