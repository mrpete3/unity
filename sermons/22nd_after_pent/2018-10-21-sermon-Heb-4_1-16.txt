## Old Testament [Ec 5:10-20 ESV]

[10] He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity. [11] When
goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? [12] Sweet is the 
sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.

[13] There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, [14] and those riches 
were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. [15] As he came from his mother's womb he 
shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. [16] This also is a 
grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind? [17] Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.

[18] Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. [19] Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil---this is the gift of God. [20] For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.

## Epistle [Heb 4:1-13 (14-16) ESV; sermon text]

[1] Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to 
reach it. [2] For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not 
united by faith with those who listened. [3] For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,

> “As I swore in my wrath,\
> ‘They shall not enter my rest,’”

although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. [4] For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this 
way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” [5] And again in this passage he said,

> “They shall not enter my rest.”\

[6] Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of 
disobedience, [7] again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,

> “Today, if you hear his voice,\
> do not harden your hearts.”

[8] For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. [9] So then, there remains a Sabbath 
rest for the people of God, [10] for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.

[11] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. [12] For the word of 
God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of 
marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. [13] And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are 
naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

[14] Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our 
confession. [15] For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect 
has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. [16] Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may 
receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

[1] Φοβηθῶμεν οὖν μήποτε καταλειπομένης ἐπαγγελίας εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ δοκῇ τις ἐξ ὑμῶν ὑστερηκέναι: 
[2] καὶ γάρ ἐσμεν εὐηγγελισμένοι καθάπερ κἀκεῖνοι, ἀλλ' οὐκ ὠφέλησεν ὁ λόγος τῆς ἀκοῆς ἐκείνους, μὴ συγκεκερασμένους τῇ πίστει τοῖς ἀκούσασιν. 
[3] εἰσερχόμεθα γὰρ εἰς [τὴν] κατάπαυσιν οἱ πιστεύσαντες, καθὼς εἴρηκεν, Ὡς ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου, Εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου, καίτοι τῶν ἔργων ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου γενηθέντων. 
[4] εἴρηκεν γάρ που περὶ τῆς ἑβδόμης οὕτως, Καὶ κατέπαυσεν ὁ θεὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ: 
[5] καὶ ἐν τούτῳ πάλιν, Εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου. 
[6] ἐπεὶ οὖν ἀπολείπεται τινὰς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς αὐτήν, καὶ οἱ πρότερον εὐαγγελισθέντες οὐκ εἰσῆλθον δι' ἀπείθειαν, 
[7] πάλιν τινὰ ὁρίζει ἡμέραν, Σήμερον, ἐν Δαυὶδ λέγων μετὰ τοσοῦτον χρόνον, καθὼς προείρηται, Σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε, μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν. 
[8] εἰ γὰρ αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς κατέπαυσεν, οὐκ ἂν περὶ ἄλλης ἐλάλει μετὰ ταῦτα ἡμέρας. 
[9] ἄρα ἀπολείπεται σαββατισμὸς τῷ λαῷ τοῦ θεοῦ: 
[10] ὁ γὰρ εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς κατέπαυσεν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων ὁ θεός. 
[11] σπουδάσωμεν οὖν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν κατάπαυσιν, ἵνα μὴ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ τις ὑποδείγματι πέσῃ τῆς ἀπειθείας. 
[12] Ζῶν γὰρ ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐνεργὴς καὶ τομώτερος ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν μάχαιραν δίστομον καὶ διϊκνούμενος ἄχρι μερισμοῦ ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος, ἁρμῶν τε καὶ μυελῶν, καὶ κριτικὸς ἐνθυμήσεων καὶ ἐννοιῶν καρδίας: 
[13] καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν κτίσις ἀφανὴς ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, πάντα δὲ γυμνὰ καὶ τετραχηλισμένα τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ, πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος. 
[14] Ἔχοντες οὖν ἀρχιερέα μέγαν διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς, Ἰησοῦν τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ, κρατῶμεν τῆς ὁμολογίας: 
[15] οὐ γὰρ ἔχομεν ἀρχιερέα μὴ δυνάμενον συμπαθῆσαι ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν, πεπειρασμένον δὲ κατὰ πάντα καθ' ὁμοιότητα χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας. 
[16] προσερχώμεθα οὖν μετὰ παρρησίας τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος, ἵνα λάβωμεν ἔλεος καὶ χάριν εὕρωμεν εἰς εὔκαιρον βοήθειαν.


## Holy Gospel [Mk 10:23-31 ESV]

[23] And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom
of God!” [24] And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter 
the kingdom of God! [25] It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom 
of God.” [26] And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?” [27] Jesus looked at them and 
said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” [28] Peter began to say to him, “See,
we have left everything and followed you.” [29] Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers
or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, [30] who will not receive a hundredfold 
now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come 
eternal life. [31] But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”

## Introit [Ps 34:1-4, 17; antiphon: Ps 34:18]

> The LORD is near to the broken- | hearted\*\
> and saves the crushed in | spirit.\
> I will bless the LORD at | all times;\*\
> his praise shall continually be | in my mouth.\
> My soul makes its boast | in the LORD;\*\
> let the humble hear | and be glad.\
> Oh, magnify the | LORD with me,\*\
> and let us exalt his name to- | gether!\
> I sought the LORD, and he | answered me\*\
> and delivered me from | all my fears.\
> When the righteous cry for help, the | LORD hears\*\
> and delivers them out of all their | troubles.\
