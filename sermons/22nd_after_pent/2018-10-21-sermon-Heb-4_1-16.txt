## Old Testament [Ec 5:10-20 ESV]

[10] He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity. [11] When
goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? [12] Sweet is the 
sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.

[13] There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, [14] and those riches 
were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. [15] As he came from his mother's womb he 
shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. [16] This also is a 
grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind? [17] Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.

[18] Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. [19] Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil---this is the gift of God. [20] For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.

## Epistle [Heb 4:1-13 (14-16) ESV; sermon text]

[1] Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to 
reach it. [2] For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not 
united by faith with those who listened. [3] For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,

> “As I swore in my wrath,\
> ‘They shall not enter my rest,’”

although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. [4] For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this 
way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” [5] And again in this passage he said,

> “They shall not enter my rest.”\

[6] Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of 
disobedience, [7] again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,

> “Today, if you hear his voice,\
> do not harden your hearts.”

[8] For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. [9] So then, there remains a Sabbath 
rest for the people of God, [10] for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.

[11] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. [12] For the word of 
God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of 
marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. [13] And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are 
naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

[14] Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our 
confession. [15] For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect 
has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. [16] Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may 
receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

[1] Φοβηθῶμεν οὖν μήποτε καταλειπομένης ἐπαγγελίας εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ δοκῇ τις ἐξ ὑμῶν ὑστερηκέναι: 
[2] καὶ γάρ ἐσμεν εὐηγγελισμένοι καθάπερ κἀκεῖνοι, ἀλλ' οὐκ ὠφέλησεν ὁ λόγος τῆς ἀκοῆς ἐκείνους, μὴ συγκεκερασμένους τῇ πίστει τοῖς ἀκούσασιν. 
[3] εἰσερχόμεθα γὰρ εἰς [τὴν] κατάπαυσιν οἱ πιστεύσαντες, καθὼς εἴρηκεν, Ὡς ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου, Εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου, καίτοι τῶν ἔργων ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου γενηθέντων. 
[4] εἴρηκεν γάρ που περὶ τῆς ἑβδόμης οὕτως, Καὶ κατέπαυσεν ὁ θεὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ: 
[5] καὶ ἐν τούτῳ πάλιν, Εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου. 
[6] ἐπεὶ οὖν ἀπολείπεται τινὰς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς αὐτήν, καὶ οἱ πρότερον εὐαγγελισθέντες οὐκ εἰσῆλθον δι' ἀπείθειαν, 
[7] πάλιν τινὰ ὁρίζει ἡμέραν, Σήμερον, ἐν Δαυὶδ λέγων μετὰ τοσοῦτον χρόνον, καθὼς προείρηται, Σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε, μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν. 
[8] εἰ γὰρ αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς κατέπαυσεν, οὐκ ἂν περὶ ἄλλης ἐλάλει μετὰ ταῦτα ἡμέρας. 
[9] ἄρα ἀπολείπεται σαββατισμὸς τῷ λαῷ τοῦ θεοῦ: 
[10] ὁ γὰρ εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς κατέπαυσεν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων ὁ θεός. 
[11] σπουδάσωμεν οὖν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν κατάπαυσιν, ἵνα μὴ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ τις ὑποδείγματι πέσῃ τῆς ἀπειθείας. 
[12] Ζῶν γὰρ ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐνεργὴς καὶ τομώτερος ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν μάχαιραν δίστομον καὶ διϊκνούμενος ἄχρι μερισμοῦ ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος, ἁρμῶν τε καὶ μυελῶν, καὶ κριτικὸς ἐνθυμήσεων καὶ ἐννοιῶν καρδίας: 
[13] καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν κτίσις ἀφανὴς ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, πάντα δὲ γυμνὰ καὶ τετραχηλισμένα τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ, πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος. 
[14] Ἔχοντες οὖν ἀρχιερέα μέγαν διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς, Ἰησοῦν τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ, κρατῶμεν τῆς ὁμολογίας: 
[15] οὐ γὰρ ἔχομεν ἀρχιερέα μὴ δυνάμενον συμπαθῆσαι ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν, πεπειρασμένον δὲ κατὰ πάντα καθ' ὁμοιότητα χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας. 
[16] προσερχώμεθα οὖν μετὰ παρρησίας τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος, ἵνα λάβωμεν ἔλεος καὶ χάριν εὕρωμεν εἰς εὔκαιρον βοήθειαν.


## Holy Gospel [Mk 10:23-31 ESV]

[23] And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom
of God!” [24] And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter 
the kingdom of God! [25] It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom 
of God.” [26] And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?” [27] Jesus looked at them and 
said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” [28] Peter began to say to him, “See,
we have left everything and followed you.” [29] Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers
or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, [30] who will not receive a hundredfold 
now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come 
eternal life. [31] But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
You know the Third Commandment:

> **Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.** _What does this mean?_ We should fear and love God so that we do not despise preaching and His Word, but hold it sacred and gladly hear and learn it.

That is the Third Commandment as you learned it in the catechism.
But how does this compare to how God gives the commandment to Moses on Mount Sinai?
It is written,

> **"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."** ([Ex 20:8‑11](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+20/) ESV)

The Third Commandment even comes with its own explanation in the Bible!
Why, then did Martin Luther change it?
We should never mess with what God clearly says, so let us look into it.

Please turn your attention to the word *Sabbath*. *Sabbath* means *rest*.
God created light and sun and moon and stars and land and sea and all the creatures that dwell thereon and therein in six days and He rested on the seventh.

> **Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.** ([Gn 2:1‑3](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2:1/) ESV)

It is awesome to hear what God accomplished in six days, and beyond our imaginations to comprehend what it all was.
For here we stand as His creatures, created on the sixth day in God's image ([Gn 1:27](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1:27/)) and surrounded by everything He made for us.
Was God tired after making everything that He *needed* to rest?
I do not know.
Can God be tired?
(He certainly does tire of our sin.)
God rested and told us to rest---He *gave us a day to rest* from our work.
(*Thank you, Lord, I need that rest!*)
Work six and rest one; the rest is a gift from God.

For though God rested, He made the Sabbath for man, not man for the Sabbath, as our Lord Jesus Christ clearly teaches us.
The Gospels reveal to us that Jesus butts heads with the Pharisees over and over again about the Sabbath.

> **One _Sabbath_ [Jesus] was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. And the Pharisees were saying to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?” And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did, _when he was in need and was hungry_, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, _which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat_, and also gave it to those who were with him?” And he said to them, _“The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”_** ([Mk 2:23‑28](https://www.esv.org/Mark+2:23/) ESV)

*Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath*---make no mistake---*Jesus says He is God*, for we know who made the Sabbath and we know who decides what the Sabbath is for.
*God* made the Sabbath and *God* tells us what the Sabbath is for---it is for rest---*Sabbath* means *rest*.
(Please share that with anyone who teaches that Jesus is not God.)
Jesus clearly teaches that it is okay for Him and His disciples to pluck heads of grain on the Sabbath like it was okay for David and his men to eat the bread of the Presence *because Jesus decides what you can and cannot do on the Sabbath*---He has the authority.

Now in this particular case, Jesus brings up David and his men.
David has just vowed his friendhip with Jonathan, the son of King Saul, but King Saul is jealous of David and wants to kill him.
(Let us jump to 1 Samuel, chapter 21.)
So David and his men flee from Jerusalem and come to Nob, and there they find Ahimelech the high priest and the the tabernacle with the ark of the covenant.
The tabernacle used to be in Shiloh, but it seems to have been moved from Shiloh to Nob, as the Bible does mention that Shiloh was destroyed ([Jer 7:12](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+7:12/)).
Check it out in the Bible: David and his men have *no business* eating the bread in the tabernacle---even the old bread that has been replaced with fresh bread.
Only **"Aaron and his sons"** ([Lv 24:9](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+24:9/))---only the high priest and his sons---are to eat that bread.
David and his men are *not* the high priest *nor* his sons!
They are breaking God's law about who can and cannot eat the holy bread, and Jesus, when speaking about it, tells the Pharisees that this was okay.

Really? Okay for David and his men to eat the holy bread?
Really? Okay to profane the Sabbath?
Do you remember what happened to the man who picked up sticks on the Sabbath?

> **While the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him. And _the LORD said to Moses_, “The man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.” And all the congregation brought him outside the camp _and stoned him to death with stones, as the LORD commanded Moses_.** ([Nm 15:32‑36](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+15:32/) ESV)

God takes the Third Commandment, as you can see, very seriously.
There is no doubt about what God wanted done to the man who picked up sticks on the Sabbath,
and, yes, there is also no doubt that it is okay that Jesus and his disciples pluck grain on the Sabbath.
_They were in need._
It is not as though they could have packed their bags with food for the trip.
They are fleeing for David's life from Saul, and they fled in a hurry.
God wants to protect David and his men, and He can give the holy bread to whomever He wants.
God wants to feed His Son and His disciples on the Sabbath---not let them go hungry---for they are proclaiming the kingdom of heaven to sinners!

For Jesus has just healed the paralytic and told him,
**“Son, your sins are forgiven”** ([Mk 2:5](https://www.esv.org/Mark+2:5/) ESV), and the paralytic rose immediately and picked up his bed!
As much as Jesus is healing, He is also casting out demons.
Is not that a relief---to have the devil thrown off of you?
*That*, beloved in the Lord, is the rest Christ has won for you.
Is not that a relief---to be able to walk after being paralyzed?
*That*, beloved in the Lord, is the rest Christ has won for you.
Jesus comes to give you rest from paralysis.
Jesus comes to give you rest from the devil.
Jesus *comes to give you rest from your sins*.

*[Point to the Crucifixion window]*
Behold the burden of your sins: *death*.
Yet Jesus is without sin---not His own.
He is bearing *your* sin.
Behold your Lord Jesus bearing your sin and *giving you rest*---*real big rest*---take a break from the burden of your sin, Jesus has handled it!
And in the package He throws off the devil and heals your diseases.
This is the rest God intends for the Israelites---greater than entering the land of Canaan.
This is the rest God intends for the Gentiles.
Beloved in the Lord, this is the rest God intends *for you*---to be relieved from the burden of your sins!
Oh, and did I mention that He not only takes your sins upon Himself and your death upon Himself, but throws away death itself?
Death itself is destined for the lake of fire ([Rv 20:14](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+20:14/)).
Yes! We are talking eternal *life* for all believers in Christ!
By faith in His atoning blood shed for you on the Cross and by faith in His Baptism, you have what He says.
He has washed your sins and imparted to you the daily power of His death and Resurrection ([Rm 6:4](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6:4/); [Col 2:12](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+2:12/)) and the final power of His death and Resurrection in that you will live forever---not in the old body you have now that will grow weak and die, but in a brand-new body like His. Alleluia!
Our Lord Jesus invites you,

> **"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, _and I will give you rest_. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."** ([Mt 11:28‑30](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+11:28/) ESV)

Jesus is your rest; Jesus is your Sabbath---the Third Commandment is fulfilled by Christ's in your life.
Take a day off---it is God's will---but it can be any day of the week for those who rest in Christ ([Col 2:16‑17](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+2:16/)).
And use that day to hear His Word and rest your body.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

## Notes

Was there ever a time or place in history where there was a six-day week?
Was there ever a time or place in history where there was an eight-day week?
Actually, [the Romans and Etruscans did at one time have an eight-day week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nundinae).
In any case, history is dominated and the world today universally follows a seven-day week, just as it is in the Bible.
Let that be a clue to the world about Jesus.
