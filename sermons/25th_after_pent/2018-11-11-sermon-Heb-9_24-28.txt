## During the service

* Today is Veterans' Day. Prayer for veterans: *O Creator of the universe, You did not form Adam from the dust of the world so that his children would spill their brothers' blood in that dust. With Adam's sin came death, destruction, and war. Yet you did not turn from your fallen creation but embraced it in the flesh of Your incarnate Son, winning our peace with You through His death and resurrection. Still, humanity rebels, and evil flourishes with wars and rumors of war. Young men and women have protected and today still protect our nation in the profession of arms, serving in places of danger, to shield us from the wicked instruments of Satan's hatred. We pray, dear Lord of peace, that You would protect those who wear and have worn the uniform of our country. Comfort and strengthen our sailors, Marines, soldiers, airmen, and coast guardsmen. Be with their loved ones who must wait at home while they go to far and distant lands, answering the call of duty. Guide the leaders of this world that they may seek to walk in peace so that the skills of warriors may not be used except to deter those who would seek to harm us. We ask this in the name of the Prince of Peace, the only Savior of the world, Jesus the Christ. Amen.*

## Old Testament [1Ki 17:8‑16 ESV]

[8] Then the word of the LORD came to him, [9] “Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you.” [10] So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, “Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.” [11] And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, “Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” [12] And she said, “As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die.” [13] And Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go and do as you have said. But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make something for yourself and your son. [14] For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘The jar of flour shall not be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty, until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth.’” [15] And she went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days. [16] The jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah.

## Epistle [Heb 9:24‑28 ESV; sermon text]

[24] For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
[25] Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own,
[26] for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. [27] And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, [28] so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 12:38‑44 ESV]

[38] And in his teaching he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces [39] and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, [40] who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”

[41] And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. [42] And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. [43] And he called his disciples to him and said to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. [44] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. If you pay attention to Jewish holidays, or have heard of them and wondered what they are, we are face-to-face today in the Epistle reading with *Yom Kippur*---*Yom*---day---*Kippur*---atonement.
*Yom Kippur* is the *Day of Atonement*.
What's a Jewish holiday, you say?
*Yom Kippur* is the cornerstone of Christian faith, as you will see.
This year Yom Kippur was observed September 18-19, in case you missed it.
*And*, I want you to know that Yom Kippur is an observance commanded by God in Leviticus, chapter 16; so you may ask, "If God commands it, why don't we Christians observe it with the Jews?" Well, let me tell you ...

Our Epistle reading from Hebrews, chapter 9 teaches us,

> **For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own.**

**_The high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own_** is *Yom Kippur*.
For in the temple in Jerusalem there is a *Holy Place* and also the *Most Holy Place*, separated from the *Holy Place* by a curtain.
At some time you may have heard the *Most Holy Place* called *The Holy of Holies*.
Before the curtain is the table of incense, where incense is constantly burning.
Behind the curtain is the Holy of Holies, where the ark of the covenant is with the tablets of the Ten Commandments inside.
The cover on the ark is called the Mercy Seat and above the Mercy Seat are statues of cherubim whose wings touch each other over the Mercy Seat.
And *between* the cherubim, above the Mercy Seath, is *the glory of God hidden in a cloud*.
Who is going to stand before God in the Holy of Holies?
That is the question.
In Leviticus, chapter 16, God allows the high priest---and the high priest only---to come *once a year*---on Yom Kippur---to stand before God in the Holy of Holies.
And when the high priest comes, he better come with the blood of a bull to atone for his sins ([Lv 16:6](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+16:6/)), and he better come with the blood of a goat to atone for the sins of the people ([Lv 16:15](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+16:15/)).

You see, there is nothing to understand about this passage if you have not learned about the temple; the temple is in Jerusalem.
Jesus taught in the temple ([Mk 12:35](https://www.esv.org/Mark+12:35/)) and you may remember that the temple is from where Jesus drove out the money changers ([Mt 21:12](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+21:12/)).
The temple is where animal sacrifices were made to *atone for sin*.
*Kippur* means *atonement*.
*Yom Kippur* means *Day of Atonement*.

*Atonement* is one of the most important words in the Bible along with *propitiation*, for *atonement* is what Jesus's blood does for us.
The easiest thing to remember is, as Pastor Berg and Chaplain Bauer taught me, that *atonement* means *at-one-ment*.
God and I were two, separated by my sin; *atonement* makes us one again.
St. Peter was separated from God by his sin.
When Jesus told him to put out into the water and let down his nets for a catch, Peter did it at Christ's Word and caught a large number of fish so that his nets were breaking,
and he fell before Christ and said,
**"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord"** ([Lk 5:3‑8](https://www.esv.org/Luke+5:3/) ESV).
Peter was seperated from God by his sin, and he knew it.
I was separated from God by his sin, and I knew it.
You were separated from God by your sin, and you knew it.

In case you did not know that sins separates you from God, let us review one of the Ten Commandments while we are on the subject.
We recently reviewed the Third Commandment---**Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy**---so let us move on to the Fourth: **Honor your father and your mother.**
Do you remember what God teaches Moses to do with a son who is rebellious against his parents?

> **"If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they discipline him, will not listen to them, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives, and they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ Then all the men of the city shall _stone him to death with stones_. So you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all Israel shall hear, and fear."** ([Dt 21:18‑21](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+21:18/) ESV)

Sin is serious business!
If you rebel against your parents and are a glutton and a drunkard, you deserve death by stoning.
All sin is punishable by death, for the Bible clearly teaches us **the wages of sin is death** ([Rm 6:23a](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6:23/)).
Fear God's punishment for your sins and you will see that the greatest thing for you is *atonement*---that your sin be atoned for so that you may once again be *at one* with God.

The Hebrew word for *atonement* is *kippur*, and you should also know, and keep close to your heart, that *kippur* literally means *covering*.
When atonement happens, *your sin is covered*.
Do you want to hear more about atonement?
In English you can say, "Let me cover the bill."
"Let me cover the bill" means "Let me *pay* the bill."
As far as you are concerned, there is no bill---it has been covered.
You can also look at *kippur* this way: when you look at something you see it, but when it is covered, you do not.
When God sees your sin, He will punish it, *but if your sin has been covered*, He does not see it anymore.

The Day of Atonement is the day when God does not see your sin anymore.
In the Old Testament, this was one day a year for the priest to offer the blood of a bull for himself and the blood of a goat for the people.
But you are a Christian, and for you blood greater than a goat has been shed.
*[Point to Crucifixion window]* Do you know what day that is?
Do you know who your High Priest is?
Do you know whose blood He brought to the Holy of Holies to atone for your sin.
This is not only the highlight of Hebrews, it is, in fact, the whole point of the Bible.
Christ is your High Priest who offered His own blood to atone for your sins.
Consider for a moment the power of His blood to atone for your sins.
Christ was without sin, but as just a man, his blood would not have the power to cover everyone's sin.
But Christ is *God*, and behold the infinite power of His blood to take away the sin of the world---to cover it up so that His Father is not angry at you anymore.
Please share this Good News with any sinner.

And, yes, we do observe Yom Kippur every year, and we will do it again on Good Friday.
In the mean time, however, let us observe it every day and praise our High Priest Jesus.
**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
