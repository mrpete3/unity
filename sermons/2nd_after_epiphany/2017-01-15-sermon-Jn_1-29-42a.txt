## First reading [Is 49:1‑7 ESV]

> [1] Listen to me, O coastlands,\
> and give attention, you peoples from afar.\
> The LORD called me from the womb,\
> from the body of my mother he named my name.\
> [2] He made my mouth like a sharp sword;\
> in the shadow of his hand he hid me;\
> he made me a polished arrow;\
> in his quiver he hid me away.\
> [3] And he said to me, “You are my servant,\
> Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”\
> [4] But I said, “I have labored in vain;\
> I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;\
> yet surely my right is with the LORD,\
> and my recompense with my God.”


> [5] And now the LORD says,\
> he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,\
> to bring Jacob back to him;\
> and that Israel might be gathered to him—\
> for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD,\
> and my God has become my strength—\
> [6] he says:\
> “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant\
> to raise up the tribes of Jacob\
> and to bring back the preserved of Israel;\
> I will make you as a light for the nations,\
> that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”


> [7] Thus says the LORD,\
> the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,\
> to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation,\
> the servant of rulers:\
> “Kings shall see and arise;\
> princes, and they shall prostrate themselves;\
> because of the LORD, who is faithful,\
> the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”


## Epistle [1Co 1:1‑9 ESV]

[1] Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,

[2] To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:

[3] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

[4] I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, [5] that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge—[6] even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you—[7] so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, [8] who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. [9] God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.



## Holy Gospel [Jn 1:29‑42a ESV; sermon text]

[29] The next day [John the Baptist] saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! [30] This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’ [31] I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.” [32] And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. [33] I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ [34] And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”

[35] The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, [36] and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” [37] The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. [38] Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, “What are you seeking?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?” [39] He said to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. [40] One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. [41] He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). [42] He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).

[29] Τῇ ἐπαύριον βλέπει τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐρχόμενον πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ λέγει, Ἴδε ὁ ἀμνὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ αἴρων τὴν ἁμαρτίαν τοῦ κόσμου. 
[30] οὗτός ἐστιν ὑπὲρ οὗ ἐγὼ εἶπον, Ὀπίσω μου ἔρχεται ἀνὴρ ὃς ἔμπροσθέν μου γέγονεν, ὅτι πρῶτός μου ἦν. 
[31] κἀγὼ οὐκ ᾔδειν αὐτόν, ἀλλ' ἵνα φανερωθῇ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ διὰ τοῦτο ἦλθον ἐγὼ ἐν ὕδατι βαπτίζων. 
[32] Καὶ ἐμαρτύρησεν Ἰωάννης λέγων ὅτι Τεθέαμαι τὸ πνεῦμα καταβαῖνον ὡς περιστερὰν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἔμεινεν ἐπ' αὐτόν: 
[33] κἀγὼ οὐκ ᾔδειν αὐτόν, ἀλλ' ὁ πέμψας με βαπτίζειν ἐν ὕδατι ἐκεῖνός μοι εἶπεν, Ἐφ' ὃν ἂν ἴδῃς τὸ πνεῦμα καταβαῖνον καὶ μένον ἐπ' αὐτόν, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ βαπτίζων ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ. 
[34] κἀγὼ ἑώρακα, καὶ μεμαρτύρηκα ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ. 

[35] Τῇ ἐπαύριον πάλιν εἱστήκει ὁ Ἰωάννης καὶ ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ δύο, 
[36] καὶ ἐμβλέψας τῷ Ἰησοῦ περιπατοῦντι λέγει, Ἴδε ὁ ἀμνὸς τοῦ θεοῦ. 
[37] καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ δύο μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος καὶ ἠκολούθησαν τῷ Ἰησοῦ. 
[38] στραφεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ θεασάμενος αὐτοὺς ἀκολουθοῦντας λέγει αὐτοῖς, Τί ζητεῖτε; οἱ δὲ εἶπαν αὐτῷ, Ῥαββί {ὃ λέγεται μεθερμηνευόμενον Διδάσκαλε}, ποῦ μένεις; 
[39] λέγει αὐτοῖς, Ἔρχεσθε καὶ ὄψεσθε. ἦλθαν οὖν καὶ εἶδαν ποῦ μένει, καὶ παρ' αὐτῷ ἔμειναν τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην: ὥρα ἦν ὡς δεκάτη. 
[40] ἦν Ἀνδρέας ὁ ἀδελφὸς Σίμωνος Πέτρου εἷς ἐκ τῶν δύο τῶν ἀκουσάντων παρὰ Ἰωάννου καὶ ἀκολουθησάντων αὐτῷ: 
[41] εὑρίσκει οὗτος πρῶτον τὸν ἀδελφὸν τὸν ἴδιον Σίμωνα καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Εὑρήκαμεν τὸν Μεσσίαν {ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον Χριστός}: 
[42] ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν. ἐμβλέψας αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν, Σὺ εἶ Σίμων ὁ υἱὸς Ἰωάννου: σὺ κληθήσῃ Κηφᾶς {ὃ ἑρμηνεύεται Πέτρος}.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, John the Baptist is great.
He is the old-school prophet, if I may say, dressed in a **garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food [is] locusts and wild honey**.
And **when he [sees] many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he [says] to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?”** [(Mt 3:4, 7)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+3/).
Who does he think he is, talking to the Pharisees and Sadducees like that?
He must look like a wild man.
His message is not out of line, though; he is not being too harsh on the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
And now would be a good time to review what we know about the Pharisees and the Sadducees.

Who are the Pharisees?
Originally, the name *Pharisees* meant *the separate ones*.
In other words, the Pharisees where separate from the rest of the Jews; what separated them from the rest of the Jews was their rigorous interpretation and strict observance of the Jewish Law.[^1]
They were the experts in intrepreting and living by God's holy Law.
What they thought of themselves was simple: “We keep God's rules better than you do, and you better look up to us.”
For example, the Pharisees fasted twice a week, on the second and fifth days of the week; that would be Monday and Thursday.
So after Christmastime---of course, they never celebrated Christmas even though they should have---but if they were around us and saw everyone gain ten pounds this time of the year, they would be self-assured that they were closer to God than we are because they fasted the day after Christmas, and then again three days after that.
I am saying this only for the sake of example---what would the Pharisees be doing if they were around us at Christmas?---but I assume that they would not have gained the weight we do at this time of the year.
Their simple conclusion---their simple view of themselves---is that they are more holy than we are because they keep God's Law better than we do, and their not gaining ten pounds at Christmas serves to make the point.

[^1]: *Lutheran Study Bible*, footnote on Mk 2:18.

The Pharisees were not just keeping God's Law off on their own---the common people know about them and considered them to be authorities---the Pharisees were powerful---what they said and taught influenced government and how people were expected to live their daily lives.
The Pharisaic goal for the Jews was that they return to strict observance of the Law of Moses and separate themselves from the Gentiles.
(So you can imagine what an issue they had when the first Gentiles became Christians.)

Now who are the Sadducees?
The name *Sadducees* might come from the Hebrew word for *righteous*.
These Jews held to the Law of Moses and the Oral Law[^4] but did *not* accept the traditions of the scribes and the Pharisees.
So, I would guess that the Sadducees did not fast twice a week like the Pharisees did; they might have fasted only once a year on the Day of Atonement.
(And you can imagine how the Pharisees could have interpreted their practice of fasting twice a week to be more pleasing to God than the practice of the Saducees.)
However, the Sadducees *did not believe in the the resurrection of the dead*, the Sadducees did not believe in angels, and the Sadducees did not believe in spirits---maybe like the rationalists of today---or *I'll believe it when I see it*.
Also, the Sadducees were not as pumped up about the coming Messiah as the Pharisees were.[^3]

[^3]: *Lutheran Study Bible*, *Persons and Groups of Early Christianity* [Kindle version] Loc 107662 of 152116.

[^4]: I do not know what the Oral Law was to the Sadducees.

Now the Sadducees and the Pharisees meet John the Baptist.
The only problem may be that the Sadducees and the Pharisees want John to baptize them without confessing and repenting of their sins.
They believe that John the Baptist is a prophet and they to out into the wilderness to be baptized by him [(Mt 3:7)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+3/).
John, full of the Holy Spirit, calls them out:

> **But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”** [(Mt 3:7‑10)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+3/)



> Confession cannot be false, uncertain, or fragmentary.
> A person who confesses that everything in him is nothing but sin
> includes all sins, excludes none, forgets none.
> Neither can the satisfaction [for sin] be uncertain, because it is not
> our uncertain, sinful work.
> Rather, it is the suffering and blood of the innocent Lamb of God,
> who takes away the sin of the world.[^2]

AMEN.
