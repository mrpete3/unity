## Old Testament [1Sm 3:1‑20 ESV]

[1] Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.

[2] At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place. [3] The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.

[4] Then the LORD called Samuel, and he said, “Here I am!” [5] and ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down.

[6] And the LORD called again, “Samuel!” and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” [7] Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.

[8] And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy. [9] Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

[10] And the LORD came and stood, calling as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant hears.” [11] Then the LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. [12] On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. [13] And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them. [14] Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”

[15] Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. [16] But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.” [17] And Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.” [18] So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the LORD. Let him do what seems good to him.”

[19] And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. [20] And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.

## Epistle [1Co 6:12‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[12] “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything.
[13] “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
[14] And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.
[15] Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! [16] Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.”
[17] But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. [18] Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. [19] Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, [20] for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.

[12] Πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν, ἀλλ' οὐ πάντα συμφέρει. πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν, ἀλλ' οὐκ ἐγὼ ἐξουσιασθήσομαι ὑπό τινος. 
[13] τὰ βρώματα τῇ κοιλίᾳ, καὶ ἡ κοιλία τοῖς βρώμασιν: ὁ δὲ θεὸς καὶ ταύτην καὶ ταῦτα καταργήσει. τὸ δὲ σῶμα οὐ τῇ πορνείᾳ ἀλλὰ τῷ κυρίῳ, καὶ ὁ κύριος τῷ σώματι: 
[14] ὁ δὲ θεὸς καὶ τὸν κύριον ἤγειρεν καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐξεγερεῖ διὰ τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ. 
[15] οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι τὰ σώματα ὑμῶν μέλη Χριστοῦ ἐστιν; ἄρας οὖν τὰ μέλη τοῦ Χριστοῦ ποιήσω πόρνης μέλη; μὴ γένοιτο. 
[16] [ἢ] οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ὁ κολλώμενος τῇ πόρνῃ ἓν σῶμά ἐστιν; Ἔσονται γάρ, φησίν, οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν. 
[17] ὁ δὲ κολλώμενος τῷ κυρίῳ ἓν πνεῦμά ἐστιν. 
[18] φεύγετε τὴν πορνείαν: πᾶν ἁμάρτημα ὃ ἐὰν ποιήσῃ ἄνθρωπος ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματός ἐστιν, ὁ δὲ πορνεύων εἰς τὸ ἴδιον σῶμα ἁμαρτάνει. 
[19] ἢ οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι τὸ σῶμα ὑμῶν ναὸς τοῦ ἐν ὑμῖν ἁγίου πνεύματός ἐστιν, οὗ ἔχετε ἀπὸ θεοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐστὲ ἑαυτῶν; 
[20] ἠγοράσθητε γὰρ τιμῆς: δοξάσατε δὴ τὸν θεὸν ἐν τῷ σώματι ὑμῶν.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 1:40‑51 ESV; 3 verses prepended to the lectionary verses]

[40] One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. [41] He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). [42] He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).

[43] The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” [44] Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. [45] Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” [46] Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” [47] Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” [48] Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” [49] Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” [50] Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” [51] And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
For this church year, I am preaching on the Epistle lessons, and Dennis asked me about last weeks sermon, "Pastor, did you preach on the Epistle? I didn't hear you mention it once."
I would first like to thank Dennis for listening so closely to the sermon. What I did last week was see that St. Paul, in Ephesians, chapter 3, teaches about the mystery **that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Gospel** [(Eph 3:6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+3/). 
In last weeks sermon, instead of preaching directly from the Epistle lesson, I asked myself, "St. Paul is an Old Testament expert. What would he teach from the Old Testament to show that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, along with the Jews, of heaven through Jesus Christ?"
And off I went, trying to be St. Paul, making the point that the only reason the LORD, on two occasions, did not wipe out the Israelites was that He wanted to protect His reputation with the Gentiles as the God who can be trusted to save them, even though they sin against Him.

Well, today Paul teaches about sexual immorality.
Oh, we love sexual immorality---if we have not committed sexual immorality ourselves, there is a good chance we have watched a movie depicting sexual immorality and enticing us to commit this sin or we have kept up with the news about someone else's sexual immorality.
Satan has managed to soak the world in sexual immorality.
If the UFO people (if they exist) ever came to earth, their short report would be "Humans are ruled by their sexual desires and expend most of their energy seeking to gratify those desires. Their favorite subject is sexual desire, whether they are married or not.
And next to their own desire, their second most important endeavor is to learn and talk about the sexual desires of other people. Because their minds are so occupied with sexual desire, they have trouble taking the time to care of other thigns."
There, am I far off?

Now here is what St. Paul on the subject: **"The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body."**
The reason why God gave us our bodies is to serve Jesus in righteousness, innocence, and blessedness; not to fornicate; not to adulterate; not to patronize a prostitute.

> **And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.**

Sexual immorality has great power over us, but Christ's Resurrection is greater!As surely as Christ has been raised from the dead, He gives us power by the Holy Spirit *not* to commit sexual immorality.

> **Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.”**

Gn 2:24 is marriage.
**One flesh** is sexual union.
The sexual union of a husband and his wife is not sin---it is marriage---a holy estate.
Step outside of marriage and do this and you are sinning against your own body---you are brining ruin on your own body.
The confusing part of sexual immorality is that you have married anyone you have had sexual relations with, and there Satan is hard at work.

I want you to know also what St. Paul teaches about marriage in Ephesians, chapter 5.
Marriage is a picture of Christ and His Church; marriage is a picture of who we are and who Christ is.

But St. Paul is also an Old Testament teacher.
Let us turn to our Old Testament reading about Eli and Samuel.
This is just a good place to start as any.
Samuel and Eli are in the tabernacle, but who else are there?
Eli's sons Hophni and Phinehas.
Hophni and Phinehas are famous for committing sexual immorality while serving as priests.

Because of Hophni and Phinehas's sin, they will both die on the same day in battle *and the ark of the covenant will be taken away* by the Philistines.
The ark of the covenant is God's presence; God leaves because of Hophni and Phinehas.

We do not have the ark of the covenant anymore, but what do we have?
We have Holy Communion: Christ's true body and blood.

> **The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.** [(1Co 10:16‑17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10/)

> **For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.** [(1Co 11:29‑30 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+11/)

One of the smartest things we do is that we confess and repent of our sins *every time* before we receive Christ's body and blood.
We receive the most wonderful thing with it: **given and shed for your for the forgiveness of sins**.

Jesus calls Holy Communion **"the new testament in My blood."**
In Holy Communion, He breaks into the world, full of sin and sexual immorality, and establishes His kingdom and order.

AMEN.

## Notes

1Sm 3:1. The Word of the Lord was rare because the Lord had grown tired of idolatry and sin. (See notes for 1Sm 3:3.)

1Sm 3:3. The tabernacle was at Shiloh at this time [(1Sm 2:14)](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+2/).
The *lamp of God* may refer to a lamp in the tabernacle, which may have been lit in the nighttime but extinguished during the day.
The tabernacle is first set up at Shiloh in [Jsh 18](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+18/); the tabernacle was at Shiloh through the times of the judges.
[Jer 7:12](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+7/) describes the destruction of Shiloh because of idolatry and a multitude of sin that goes with it (*den of robbers* is mentioned)---the Israelites had considered the tabernacle and the ark to be but a good luck charm next to their idols.
The Philistines may have destroyed Shiloh at the time they removed the ark to Ashdod [(1Sm 5:1)](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+5/) around 1070 B.C.

1Sm 4. The Philistines capture the ark and kill Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas.
With no ark, where has God gone?
