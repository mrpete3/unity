## First reading [Is 11:1‑10 ESV]

> [1] There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,\
> and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.\
> [2] And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him,\
> the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,\
> the Spirit of counsel and might,\
> the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.\
> [3] And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.\
> He shall not judge by what his eyes see,\
> or decide disputes by what his ears hear,\
> [4] but with righteousness he shall judge the poor,\
> and decide with equity for the meek of the earth;\
> and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,\
> and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.\
> [5] Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist,\
> and faithfulness the belt of his loins.

> [6] The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,\
> and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat,\
> and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together;\
> and a little child shall lead them.\
> [7] The cow and the bear shall graze;\
> their young shall lie down together;\
> and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.\
> [8] The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra,\
> and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.\
> [9] They shall not hurt or destroy\
> in all my holy mountain;\
> for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD\
> as the waters cover the sea.

[10] In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples—of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious.

> [1] Καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ῥάβδος ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης Ιεσσαι, καὶ ἄνθος ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης ἀναβήσεται.\
> [2] καὶ ἀναπαύσεται ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα τοῦ θεοῦ, πνεῦμα σοφίας καὶ συνέσεως, πνεῦμα βουλῆς καὶ ἰσχύος, πνεῦμα γνώσεως καὶ εὐσεβείας·\
> [3] ἐμπλήσει αὐτὸν πνεῦμα φόβου θεοῦ. οὐ κατὰ τὴν δόξαν κρινεῖ οὐδὲ κατὰ τὴν λαλιὰν ἐλέγξει,\
> [4] ἀλλὰ κρινεῖ ταπεινῷ κρίσιν καὶ ἐλέγξει τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τῆς γῆς· καὶ πατάξει γῆν τῷ λόγῳ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν πνεύματι διὰ χειλέων ἀνελεῖ ἀσεβῆ·\
> [5] καὶ ἔσται δικαιοσύνῃ ἐζωσμένος τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ εἰλημένος τὰς πλευράς.

> [6] καὶ συμβοσκηθήσεται λύκος μετὰ ἀρνός, καὶ πάρδαλις συναναπαύσεται ἐρίφῳ, καὶ μοσχάριον καὶ ταῦρος καὶ λέων ἅμα βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ παιδίον μικρὸν ἄξει αὐτούς·\
> [7] καὶ βοῦς καὶ ἄρκος ἅμα βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ ἅμα τὰ παιδία αὐτῶν ἔσονται, καὶ λέων καὶ βοῦς ἅμα φάγονται ἄχυρα.\
> [8] καὶ παιδίον νήπιον ἐπὶ τρώγλην ἀσπίδων καὶ ἐπὶ κοίτην ἐκγόνων ἀσπίδων τὴν χεῖρα ἐπιβαλεῖ.\
> [9] καὶ οὐ μὴ κακοποιήσωσιν οὐδὲ μὴ δύνωνται ἀπολέσαι οὐδένα ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, ὅτι ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ σύμπασα τοῦ γνῶναι τὸν κύριον ὡς ὕδωρ πολὺ κατακαλύψαι θαλάσσας.

[10] Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἡ ῥίζα τοῦ Ιεσσαι καὶ ὁ ἀνιστάμενος ἄρχειν ἐθνῶν, ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν, καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἀνάπαυσις αὐτοῦ τιμή.

## Epistle [Rm 15:4‑13 ESV]

[4] For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. [5] May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, [6] that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. [7] Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.

[8] For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, [9] and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,

> “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.”

[10] And again it is said,

> “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.”

[11] And again,

> “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him.”

[12] And again Isaiah says,

> “The root of Jesse will come,	even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles hope.”

[13] May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.

[4] ὅσα γὰρ προεγράφη, εἰς τὴν ἡμετέραν διδασκαλίαν ἐγράφη, ἵνα διὰ τῆς ὑπομονῆς καὶ διὰ τῆς παρακλήσεως τῶν γραφῶν τὴν ἐλπίδα ἔχωμεν. 
[5] ὁ δὲ θεὸς τῆς ὑπομονῆς καὶ τῆς παρακλήσεως δῴη ὑμῖν τὸ αὐτὸ φρονεῖν ἐν ἀλλήλοις κατὰ Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν, 
[6] ἵνα ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐν ἑνὶ στόματι δοξάζητε τὸν θεὸν καὶ πατέρα τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ. 
[7] Διὸ προσλαμβάνεσθε ἀλλήλους, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς προσελάβετο ὑμᾶς, εἰς δόξαν τοῦ θεοῦ.

[8] λέγω γὰρ Χριστὸν διάκονον γεγενῆσθαι περιτομῆς ὑπὲρ ἀληθείας θεοῦ, εἰς τὸ βεβαιῶσαι τὰς ἐπαγγελίας τῶν πατέρων, 
[9] τὰ δὲ ἔθνη ὑπὲρ ἐλέους δοξάσαι τὸν θεόν: καθὼς γέγραπται,

> Διὰ τοῦτο ἐξομολογήσομαί σοι ἐν ἔθνεσιν, καὶ τῷ ὀνοματί σου ψαλῶ.

[10] καὶ πάλιν λέγει,

> Εὐφράνθητε, ἔθνη, μετὰ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.

[11] καὶ πάλιν,

> Αἰνεῖτε, πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, τὸν κύριον, καὶ ἐπαινεσάτωσαν αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ λαοί.

[12] καὶ πάλιν Ἠσαΐας λέγει,

> Ἔσται ἡ ῥίζα τοῦ Ἰεσσαί, καὶ ὁ ἀνιστάμενος ἄρχειν ἐθνῶν: ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν.

[13] ὁ δὲ θεὸς τῆς ἐλπίδος πληρώσαι ὑμᾶς πάσης χαρᾶς καὶ εἰρήνης ἐν τῷ πιστεύειν, εἰς τὸ περισσεύειν ὑμᾶς ἐν τῇ ἐλπίδι ἐν δυνάμει πνεύματος ἁγίου.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 3:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, [2] “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” [3] For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,

> “The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\
> ‘Prepare the way of the Lord;	make his paths straight.’”

[4] Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. [5] Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, [6] and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

[7] But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? [8] Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. [9] And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. [10] Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

[11] “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. [12] His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”

[1] Ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις παραγίνεται Ἰωάννης ὁ βαπτιστὴς κηρύσσων ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῆς Ἰουδαίας 
[2] [καὶ] λέγων, Μετανοεῖτε, ἤγγικεν γὰρ ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν. 
[3] οὗτος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ῥηθεὶς διὰ Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου λέγοντος,

> Φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, Ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ.

[4] Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Ἰωάννης εἶχεν τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τριχῶν καμήλου καὶ ζώνην δερματίνην περὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ, ἡ δὲ τροφὴ ἦν αὐτοῦ ἀκρίδες καὶ μέλι ἄγριον. 
[5] τότε ἐξεπορεύετο πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἱεροσόλυμα καὶ πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία καὶ πᾶσα ἡ περίχωρος τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, 
[6] καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ ποταμῷ ὑπ' αὐτοῦ ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. 

[7] Ἰδὼν δὲ πολλοὺς τῶν Φαρισαίων καὶ Σαδδουκαίων ἐρχομένους ἐπὶ τὸ βάπτισμα αὐτοῦ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν, τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς; 
[8] ποιήσατε οὖν καρπὸν ἄξιον τῆς μετανοίας: 
[9] καὶ μὴ δόξητε λέγειν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, Πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ, λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι δύναται ὁ θεὸς ἐκ τῶν λίθων τούτων ἐγεῖραι τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ. 
[10] ἤδη δὲ ἡ ἀξίνη πρὸς τὴν ῥίζαν τῶν δένδρων κεῖται: πᾶν οὖν δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν ἐκκόπτεται καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται. 

[11] ἐγὼ μὲν ὑμᾶς βαπτίζω ἐν ὕδατι εἰς μετάνοιαν: ὁ δὲ ὀπίσω μου ἐρχόμενος ἰσχυρότερός μού ἐστιν, οὗ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἱκανὸς τὰ ὑποδήματα βαστάσαι: αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ καὶ πυρί: 
[12] οὗ τὸ πτύον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ διακαθαριεῖ τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνάξει τὸν σῖτον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην, τὸ δὲ ἄχυρον κατακαύσει πυρὶ ἀσβέστῳ.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord: good old John the Baptist.
What would the Bible be without John the Baptist?
The prophet Isaiah foretold the ministry of John the Baptist, as you heard in the Holy Gospel:

> **A voice cries:**\
> **&ldquo;In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD;**\
> **make straight in the desert a highway for our God.**\
> **Every valley shall be lifted up,**\
> **and every mountain and hill be made low;**\
> **the uneven ground shall become level,**\
> **and the rough places a plain.**\
> **And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,**\
> **and all flesh shall see it together,**\
> **for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.&rdquo;** [(Is&nbsp;40:3&#x2011;5 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2040%3A3-5/)

The mouth of the LORD spoke through Isaiah that Jesus would come, and the glory of the LORD be revealed.
Of course, Isaiah said more than that about Jesus.
Our Old Testament reading from Isaiah says that He is called the Branch.

> **There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,**\
> **and a _branch_ from his roots shall bear fruit.**\
> **And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him,**\
> **the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,**\
> **the Spirit of counsel and might,**\
> **the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.** [(Is&nbsp;11:1&#x2011;2 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2011%3A1-2/)

God the Father gives His Spirit to Christ, His beloved Son.
His Son, as again Isaiah foretold, is _God with us_ yet also man, born of a virgin [(Is&nbsp;7:14)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%207%3A14/).
Never before has there been one like Christ, on whom fully rests **the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD**.

When someone has a certain *spirit* about himself, it is all about who he or she really is.
Now to talk about someone's spirit, I have to be very careful, because I do not want to break the 8th&nbsp;Commandment: **You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.** What does this mean? We should fear and love God so that we do not tell lies about our neighbor &hellip; explain everything in the kindest way.
In other words, if I am to describe someone's spirit, I am to explain everything in the kindest way, even if I believe him to have an evil spirit.
For example, if I were to tell you in 2011 what I thought about Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora, I would speak about him in the kindest way even though I believed he was a corrupt government official.
But now that the FBI and the federal prosecutor have done their jobs and have published what they found and Jimmy Dimora was found guilty of corruption in 2012, I can publicly tell you according to their investigation that Jimmy Dimora has a spirit of corruption---this is really who he is: a corrupt county commissioner who thankfully now sits in prison.
And so, to use him as a negative example---and there are others---he did a lot of &ldquo;good&rdquo; for the county---whatever his accomplishments were---and he ran for re&#x2011;election and won---but his spirit was corrupt and his deeds were nevertheless evil.
When someone has a certain spirit about himself, it is all about who he *really* is.

But Jesus has the *Holy* Spirit in full measure---in an unrestricted way that has never been seen before: **the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD**.
What we get from *John the Baptist* is a good demonstration of the Spirit of the fear of the LORD:

> **But when [John] saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them,** **&ldquo;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham as our father,&rsquo; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&rdquo;**

The Pharisees and the Saducees where considered to be holy men.
If you asked the people, many would say, &ldquo;Yes, our Pharisees and Sadducees are men of God.&rdquo;
But God knew their spirit and revealed it to John the Baptist.
John was there to get them ready for Jesus and he went right after the evil spirit of the Pharisees and the Sadducees: &ldquo;**You brood of vipers!** You are poisonous snakes that bring harm to the people, and God will punish you for your wickedness. **Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.**&rdquo;
In other words, unless your spirit changes and you show fruit for that change, you will be thrown into hell.
How is that for **the Spirit of the fear of the LORD**?

It is not comfortable to hear about hell, and as Satan has his way, you will hear about hell less and less, and some will say it does not even exist.
But unless you repent and **bear fruit in keeping with repentance**, Jesus will uncover your hypocrisy just as he did for the Pharisees and Sadducees and He will judge you righteously.
So there you have it.
The Bible speaks about the fear of the Lord in many places and in many ways, and this was just one of them.
Remove all deceit from your spirit and let Jesus come in.
**He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.**

Now the fire part is something you may wonder about.
What is this fire with which Jesus comes to baptize me?
I want to know because it sounds painful.
Well, it is painful when Jesus scrubs you of sin, but that pain is a precursor of healing.

Let me tell you about the *spirit* with which Jesus baptizes you with fire.
*[Illustration]* When the new boss comes in the room and says, &ldquo;Okay. Things are going to change. Your breaks are going to be shorter and you're going to work harder,&rdquo; and then you watch him spend all day in the office eating Jack Frost donuts, drinking coffee, and hanging out on Facebook, what is the spirit of the boss? Hypocrisy.
He criticized you but not himself.
He sets a standard that he cannot meet himself.
Now watch Jesus.
All the way from Christmas to Good Friday, we will watch Him very closely.
*[Survey the stained glass windows.]*
And when our Lord dies on the Cross, bearing our sins, *you will see Him going through a fire that is much greater than any fire He will ever put us through*. Alleluia!
For what He puts us through when He baptizes us with the Holy Spirit and fire is nothing compared to His own suffering on the Cross by which He Himself purifies us from all sins.

When He was done with His fire on the Cross, all our sins slid right off us.
Our sins require no scouring to be removed, only faith in Jesus.
Jesus took on the scouring our sins require, and our sufferings are but the discomfort of sins sliding right off of us when we believe in Him.
If our sins made a valley that could not be crossed, Jesus on the Cross lifted the valley up.
If our sins made a mountain too treacherous to climb, Jesus on the Cross made the way level.
On the Cross the glory of the LORD is revealed, and all flesh has seen it together.
The name of Jesus be praised! AMEN.
