## Old Testament [Is 40:1‑11 ESV]

> [1] Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.\
> [2] Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,\
> and cry to her\
> that her warfare is ended,\
> that her iniquity is pardoned,\
> that she has received from the LORD's hand\
> double for all her sins.

> [3] A voice cries:\
> “In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD;\
> make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\
> [4] Every valley shall be lifted up,\
> and every mountain and hill be made low;\
> the uneven ground shall become level,\
> and the rough places a plain.\
> [5] And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,\
> and all flesh shall see it together,\
> for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”

> [6] A voice says, “Cry!”\
> And I said, “What shall I cry?”\
> All flesh is grass,\
> and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.\
> [7] The grass withers, the flower fades\
> when the breath of the LORD blows on it;\
> surely the people are grass.\
> [8] The grass withers, the flower fades,\
> but the word of our God will stand forever.

> [9] Go on up to a high mountain,\
> O Zion, herald of good news;\
> lift up your voice with strength,\
> O Jerusalem, herald of good news;\
> lift it up, fear not;\
> say to the cities of Judah,\
> “Behold your God!”\
> [10] Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might,\
> and his arm rules for him;\
> behold, his reward is with him,\
> and his recompense before him.\
> [11] He will tend his flock like a shepherd;\
> he will gather the lambs in his arms;\
> he will carry them in his bosom,\
> and gently lead those that are with young.

## Epistle [2Pt 3:8‑14 ESV; sermon text]

[8] But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. [9] The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. [10] But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.

[11] Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, [12] waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! [13] But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

[14] Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace.

[8] Ἓν δὲ τοῦτο μὴ λανθανέτω ὑμᾶς, ἀγαπητοί, ὅτι μία ἡμέρα παρὰ κυρίῳ ὡς χίλια ἔτη καὶ χίλια ἔτη ὡς ἡμέρα μία. 
[9] οὐ βραδύνει κύριος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ὥς τινες βραδύτητα ἡγοῦνται, ἀλλὰ μακροθυμεῖ εἰς ὑμᾶς, μὴ βουλόμενός τινας ἀπολέσθαι ἀλλὰ πάντας εἰς μετάνοιαν χωρῆσαι. 
[10] Ηξει δὲ ἡμέρα κυρίου ὡς κλέπτης, ἐν ἧ οἱ οὐρανοὶ ῥοιζηδὸν παρελεύσονται, στοιχεῖα δὲ καυσούμενα λυθήσεται, καὶ γῆ καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ ἔργα εὑρεθήσεται. 

[11] τούτων οὕτως πάντων λυομένων ποταποὺς δεῖ ὑπάρχειν [ὑμᾶς] ἐν ἁγίαις ἀναστροφαῖς καὶ εὐσεβείαις, 
[12] προσδοκῶντας καὶ σπεύδοντας τὴν παρουσίαν τῆς τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμέρας, δι' ἣν οὐρανοὶ πυρούμενοι λυθήσονται καὶ στοιχεῖα καυσούμενα τήκεται. 
[13] καινοὺς δὲ οὐρανοὺς καὶ γῆν καινὴν κατὰ τὸ ἐπάγγελμα αὐτοῦ προσδοκῶμεν, ἐν οἷς δικαιοσύνη κατοικεῖ. 

[14] Διό, ἀγαπητοί, ταῦτα προσδοκῶντες σπουδάσατε ἄσπιλοι καὶ ἀμώμητοι αὐτῷ εὑρεθῆναι ἐν εἰρήνῃ.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 1:1‑8 ESV]

[1] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

[2] As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,

> “Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\
> who will prepare your way,\
> [3] the voice of one crying in the wilderness:\
> ‘Prepare the way of the Lord,\
> make his paths straight,’”
	
[4] John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. [5] And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. [6] Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. [7] And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. [8] I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”

## Introit [Ps 99:99-99; antiphon: Ps 99:99]

> I will speak of your testimonies before kings, | [O Lord,]\*\
> and shall not be | put to shame.\

## Collect

Almighty and gracious Lord, ... through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

You have surely heard this verse before: **"That with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."** 
Well, you heard it again in today's Epistle lesson: **"With the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."** 
What does this mean?
St. Peter tells us: **"The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."**
It simply means that God is patient with sinners, not wanting that any of us should perish, but that we all should reach repentance, that is, faith in Christ, as in **"God, be merciful to me, a sinner!"** [(Lk 18:13 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+18/), and the proclamation of mercy, **"With his wounds we are healed"** [(Is 53:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53/).

God is patient with sinners and He has not wiped out the world yet.
He is waiting, calling preachers like John the Baptist to go out and _**make straight in the desert a highway for our God**_ [(Is 40:3 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+40/).

You may have noticed that at Paula's funeral, we did a little less hymn singing and a little more *Bach*, as in Johann Sebastian Bach.
Paula loves hymns as much as anyone, but she *really* loves Bach.
Bach's sacred music is so beautiful that I know a Lutheran pastor in Japan, Pastor Manabu Wakabayashi, who was converted to faith in Christ by Bach's music.
Most of it is instrumental, and any of Bach's choral music that Pastor Wakabayashi might have heard would not have been sung in Japanese---the Gospel was preached by the music alone.
I learned in seminary that Bach spent more time studying theology than he did practicing the organ.
The Bible is the origin of Bach's music, and Bach's music is, as much as anything, God's Word combined with music, and God's Word always succeeds in the thing for He sent it [(Is 55:11)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+55/). 

We have heard in our Old Testament reading the proclamation of the prophet Isaiah:

> **Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.**\
> **Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,**\
> **and cry to her**\
> **that her warfare is ended,**\
> **that her iniquity is pardoned,**\
> **that she has received from the LORD's hand**\
> **double for all her sins.** [(Is 40:1‑2 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+40/)

There is the message of peace.

AMEN.
