## Old Testament [Gn 17:1‑7, 15‑16 ESV]

[1] When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, 
[2] that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.” 
[3] Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him, 
[4] “Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. 
[5] No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. 
[6] I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you. 
[7] And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you. 

[15] And God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. 
[16] I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”

## Epistle [Rm 5:1‑11 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
[2] Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
[3] Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, 
[4] and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 
[5] and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. 

[6] For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 
[7] For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die---[8] but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 
[9] Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. 
[10] For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. 
[11] More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

[1] Δικαιωθέντες οὖν ἐκ πίστεως εἰρήνην ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν διὰ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, 
[2] δι' οὗ καὶ τὴν προσαγωγὴν ἐσχήκαμεν [τῇ πίστει] εἰς τὴν χάριν ταύτην ἐν ἧ ἑστήκαμεν, καὶ καυχώμεθα ἐπ' ἐλπίδι τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ. 
[3] οὐ μόνον δέ, ἀλλὰ καὶ καυχώμεθα ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν, εἰδότες ὅτι ἡ θλῖψις ὑπομονὴν κατεργάζεται, 
[4] ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ δοκιμήν, ἡ δὲ δοκιμὴ ἐλπίδα: 
[5] ἡ δὲ ἐλπὶς οὐ καταισχύνει, ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ θεοῦ ἐκκέχυται ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν διὰ πνεύματος ἁγίου τοῦ δοθέντος ἡμῖν, 

[6] ἔτι γὰρ Χριστὸς ὄντων ἡμῶν ἀσθενῶν ἔτι κατὰ καιρὸν ὑπὲρ ἀσεβῶν ἀπέθανεν. 
[7] μόλις γὰρ ὑπὲρ δικαίου τις ἀποθανεῖται: ὑπὲρ γὰρ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ τάχα τις καὶ τολμᾷ ἀποθανεῖν: 
[8] συνίστησιν δὲ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀγάπην εἰς ἡμᾶς ὁ θεὸς ὅτι ἔτι ἁμαρτωλῶν ὄντων ἡμῶν Χριστὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἀπέθανεν. 
[9] πολλῷ οὖν μᾶλλον δικαιωθέντες νῦν ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ σωθησόμεθα δι' αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ὀργῆς. 
[10] εἰ γὰρ ἐχθροὶ ὄντες κατηλλάγημεν τῷ θεῷ διὰ τοῦ θανάτου τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, πολλῷ μᾶλλον καταλλαγέντες σωθησόμεθα ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ: 
[11] οὐ μόνον δέ, ἀλλὰ καὶ καυχώμενοι ἐν τῷ θεῷ διὰ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, δι' οὗ νῦν τὴν καταλλαγὴν ἐλάβομεν.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 8:27‑38 ESV]

[27] And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” 
[28] And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.” 
[29] And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.” 
[30] And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him. 

[31] And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
[32] And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 
[33] But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.” 

[34] And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. 
[35] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. 
[36] For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? 
[37] For what can a man give in return for his soul? 
[38] For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Christ comes to shine and save sinners from death, the devil, and hell.
You cannot imagine anyone better for us than Jesus!
But as much as Jesus shines---and who can forget His Transfiguration?---we celebrated Christ's Transfiguration just two weeks ago---but as much as Jesus shines, how often does our Lord do something great and then want to keep it *hidden from the public*?
If He comes to shine, why does He hide it?
Let us begin by taking a look at the Gospel of Mark to see puzzling examples of Jesus hiding His shine.
(Our recent Holy Gospel readings have been from Mark, so we will take our examples from there.)

> **That evening at sundown they brought to [Jesus] all who were sick or oppressed by demons. And the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. _And he would not permit the demons to speak_, because they knew him.** [(Mk 1:32‑34 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+1/)

The demons know who Jesus is; the demons know He has power over them and will even say so out loud.
But Jesus does not let them talk.
"Keep you mouths shut," He tells the demons.
The demons do what they are told.

> **And a leper came to [Jesus], imploring him, and kneeling said to him, “If you will, you can make me clean.” Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, and said to him, “_See that you say nothing to anyone_, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.” But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.** [(Mk 1:40‑45 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+1/)

Jesus told the healed leper not to, but he did it anyway---the healed man told anyone who would listen what Jesus had done for him.
Now Jesus has a crowd control problem.

> **And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” And he strictly ordered them _not to make him known_.** [(Mk 3:9‑12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+3/)

Again, Jesus tells the demons to keep quiet.
In all fairness, though, take note that the next time Jesus *does* give permission to tell others what He has done.
He casts the legion of demons out of the man and into the pigs and then tells that man, now clothed and in his right mind---God be praised!---clothed and in His right mind by the power of Christ's Word, Jesus tells him, **“Go home to your friends and _tell them_ how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you”** [(Mk 5:19 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+5/).

Next in Mark's Gospel, He brings Jairus's daughter back from death.
Peter, James, and John, the eyewitnesses of Christ's Transfiguration, are also eyewitnesses of Christ bringing the little girl back from death with this command: **"Little girl, I say to you, arise!"**
Beloved in the Lord, note this well: Christ's Word has power over death; Christ's Word has power over the devil; Christ's Word has power over sickness; Christ's Word has power to *forgive sins*.
Yes, remember the paralytic in Capernaum in Mark, chapter 2.
Jesus says to him, **"Son, your sins are forgiven,"** and he rises and immediately picks up his bed, forgiven and healed by the Word of Christ [(Mk 2:5‑12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+2/).
But with Jairus's daughter, Jesus is back to His old routine, He **strictly charges them that no one should know this, and tells them to give [the little girl] something to eat** [(Mk 5:43 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+5/).

If keeping his miracles quiet is intended for crowd control, it does not work.
By this time, there are so many people following Jesus that He has to feed the 5,000.
But before we get to today's Holy Gospel in Mark, chapter 8, we have one more miracle.
Our Lord puts His fingers into the ears of the deaf man, spits, and touches his tongue to heal him.
And with Christ's command---**"Ephphatha! Be opened!"**---the deaf man is healed.
Again, 

> **Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.** [(Mk 7:36 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+7/)

Next He feeds the 4,000.
And just before today's Holy Gospel, Jesus heals the blind man at Bethsaida and tells him, **"Do not even enter the village"** [(Mk 8:26 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+8/).

But today, He asks His disciples, **"Who do people say that I am?"**, referring to the crowds that follow Him around.
And Peter answers, **"You are the Christ"**; in Matthew's Gospel he says, **"You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God"** [(Mt 16:16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+16/), and this is true: Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God.
Is it now finally time to proclaim Jesus publicly?
(Billy Graham would have.)
No, now is not the time.
**He strictly charged them to tell no one about him** [(Mk 8:30 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+8/). 

Why does Jesus keep doing that?
Why does He do something great---I mean look, Satan does terrible things to people and they wind up dead---and Jesus throws Satan out---why does our Lord do something great that all people can benefit from and then wants to keep it secret?
Is He trying to keep it secret until He figures out a way to charge people for it?
Definitely not!
He is going to give it away.
Our answer, though, to why Jesus wants it quiet for now may be in the very next verses.
Today we find out what is on Jesus' mind all this time.
Do you ever want to know what is on Jesus' mind?
Let Him tell you.

> **And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.** [(Mk 8:31 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+8/)

What is on Jesus' mind?
*His Cross ... and His Resurrection.*
That is what is on His mind.
Beloved in the Lord, there is a difference---there is a difference between the idea man and the I'm-gonna-do-this man.
Jesus is our I'm-gonna-do-this Man.
What is the difference between an idea man and an I'm-gonna-do-this man?
*[Illustration]* For those of you who follow the Olympics, there is a difference between someone who critiques ice dancing and someone who can actually lace on a pair of skates and lift his partner onto his shoulders while executing a spin.
(Trina and I used to do that.)
There is a difference between the idea man and the I'm-gonna-do-this man.
Jesus does not just show up on the scene and say, "I have an idea to make your life better: Love one another."
Jesus does not just show up on the scene and say, "I have an idea to get out of debt. Stop spending money."
Figuratively speaking, though, He *is* here for debt relief, yours and mine, but not as the idea man: Jesus is our I'm-gonna-do-this man.
It is about His death and Resurrection.

You may be familiar with the parable He teaches in Matthew, chapter 18 about the servant who is forgiven a debt of ten thousand talents.
It is the perfect illustration of who you and I are, for we have a debt we cannot pay.
A debt of ten thousand talents is bigger than you could work off in a lifetime.
Think of it as our national debt but *you* are personally responsible for it---you will never pay it off.
Think for a moment not of the sins you have committed in action, just in *thought*.
What kept you from actually committing those sins you *thought* of doing?
The grace of God.
If it were not for the grace of God, you would be impulsive and commit every sin you thought of.
Imagine your situation now if you had acted on every sin you thought of. ...
It is not very nice.

A sin in thought alone is a debt you owe to God, for He kept you from getting out of control.
You and I are debtors to God beyond our imagination and more than we would like to acknowledge.
Some say preaching this way is a scare tactic so the Church can control people's lives.
I leave it to the Holy Spirit to remind you according to God's holy Ten Commandments what you have done in thought, word, and deed, and what you owe God.
You and I are sinners and I an the chief of sinners---begging before God for we have wasted what He gave us and would have destroyed much more.

There is no job we can do well enough that can possibly generate the money to pay what we owe.
But *Jesus* does it well enough: He is our I'm-gonna-do-this man, and we are going to watch Him all of Lent.
For Him, casting out demons and healing and feeding is not the main reason He comes.
We would like to have Him as King if that were all He does, but He does much greater: *He pays our debt.*
Why is Jesus telling some to keep quiet?
*Because He is focused on paying our debt.*
He will do it by His own death, and beloved in the Lord, that is what He is here to do---to die for our sins and pay our debt to God.

Consider your debt and remember that Good Friday---and I mean *good*---Good Friday is around the corner.
Jesus is focused on Good Friday and does not want any distraction---focused not on getting us to pay our debt---Jesus is no bill collector---but on taking our debt on His shoulders and paying it in full.
Our debt will crush Him and He will die.
When our debt is paid in full, we will behold Jesus, our greatest friend, dead and hanging on a Cross in punishment for our sins.
His blood pays the debt.

Beloved in the Lord, we will not stay sad for long, for when the sun rises on Easter Sunday, Jesus will rise, alive, and our debt is gone.
AMEN.

## Notes

Rm 5:3. Suffering produces endurance.

Rm 5:6‑8. Christ died for the ungodly.

Rm 5:9. Justified by Jesus' blood; save from the wrath to come.

We observed Transfiguration two weeks ago, but Christ's Transfiguration is recorded in the next chaper: Mark, chapter 9.
