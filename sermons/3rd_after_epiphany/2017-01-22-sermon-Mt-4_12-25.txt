## Old Testament [Is 9:1‑4 ESV]

[1]  But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

> [2]  The people who walked in darkness\
> have seen a great light;\
> those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,\
> on them has light shone.\
> [3] You have multiplied the nation;\
> you have increased its joy;\
> they rejoice before you\
> as with joy at the harvest,\
> as they are glad when they divide the spoil.\
> [4] For the yoke of his burden,\
> and the staff for his shoulder,\
> the rod of his oppressor,\
> you have broken as on the day of Midian.

## Epistle [1Co 1:10‑18 ESV]

[10] I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. [11] For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers. [12] What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” [13] Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? [14] I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, [15] so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. [16] (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) [17] For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
[18] For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

[10] Παρακαλῶ δὲ ὑμᾶς, ἀδελφοί, διὰ τοῦ ὀνόματος τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ἵνα τὸ αὐτὸ λέγητε πάντες, καὶ μὴ ᾖ ἐν ὑμῖν σχίσματα, ἦτε δὲ κατηρτισμένοι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ νοῒ καὶ ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ γνώμῃ. 
[11] ἐδηλώθη γάρ μοι περὶ ὑμῶν, ἀδελφοί μου, ὑπὸ τῶν Χλόης ὅτι ἔριδες ἐν ὑμῖν εἰσιν. 
[12] λέγω δὲ τοῦτο, ὅτι ἕκαστος ὑμῶν λέγει, Ἐγὼ μέν εἰμι Παύλου, Ἐγὼ δὲ Ἀπολλῶ, Ἐγὼ δὲ Κηφᾶ, Ἐγὼ δὲ Χριστοῦ. 
[13] μεμέρισται ὁ Χριστός; μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, ἢ εἰς τὸ ὄνομα Παύλου ἐβαπτίσθητε; 
[14] εὐχαριστῶ [τῷ θεῷ] ὅτι οὐδένα ὑμῶν ἐβάπτισα εἰ μὴ Κρίσπον καὶ Γάϊον, 
[15] ἵνα μή τις εἴπῃ ὅτι εἰς τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα ἐβαπτίσθητε. 
[16] ἐβάπτισα δὲ καὶ τὸν Στεφανᾶ οἶκον: λοιπὸν οὐκ οἶδα εἴ τινα ἄλλον ἐβάπτισα. 
[17] οὐ γὰρ ἀπέστειλέν με Χριστὸς βαπτίζειν ἀλλὰ εὐαγγελίζεσθαι, οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ λόγου, ἵνα μὴ κενωθῇ ὁ σταυρὸς τοῦ Χριστοῦ. 
[18] Ὁ λόγος γὰρ ὁ τοῦ σταυροῦ τοῖς μὲν ἀπολλυμένοις μωρία ἐστίν, τοῖς δὲ σῳζομένοις ἡμῖν δύναμις θεοῦ ἐστιν.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 4:12‑25 ESV; sermon text]

[12] Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. [13] And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, [14] so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:

> [15] “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,\
> the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—\
> [16] the people dwelling in darkness\
> have seen a great light,\
> and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death,\
> on them a light has dawned.”
 
 [17] From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”

[18] While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [19] And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” [20] Immediately they left their nets and followed him. [21] And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. [22] Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.

[23] And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people. [24] So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those having seizures, and paralytics, and he healed them. [25] And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.

[12] Ἀκούσας δὲ ὅτι Ἰωάννης παρεδόθη ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν. 
[13] καὶ καταλιπὼν τὴν Ναζαρὰ ἐλθὼν κατῴκησεν εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ τὴν παραθαλασσίαν ἐν ὁρίοις Ζαβουλὼν καὶ Νεφθαλίμ:

> [16] ὁ λαὸς ὁ καθήμενος ἐν σκότει φῶς εἶδεν μέγα, καὶ τοῖς καθημένοις ἐν χώρᾳ καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου φῶς ἀνέτειλεν αὐτοῖς.

[17] Ἀπὸ τότε ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς κηρύσσειν καὶ λέγειν, Μετανοεῖτε, ἤγγικεν γὰρ ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν. 

[18] Περιπατῶν δὲ παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν τῆς Γαλιλαίας εἶδεν δύο ἀδελφούς, Σίμωνα τὸν λεγόμενον Πέτρον καὶ Ἀνδρέαν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, βάλλοντας ἀμφίβληστρον εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν: ἦσαν γὰρ ἁλιεῖς. 
[19] καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς, Δεῦτε ὀπίσω μου, καὶ ποιήσω ὑμᾶς ἁλιεῖς ἀνθρώπων. 
[20] οἱ δὲ εὐθέως ἀφέντες τὰ δίκτυα ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ. 
[21] Καὶ προβὰς ἐκεῖθεν εἶδεν ἄλλους δύο ἀδελφούς, Ἰάκωβον τὸν τοῦ Ζεβεδαίου καὶ Ἰωάννην τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ μετὰ Ζεβεδαίου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν καταρτίζοντας τὰ δίκτυα αὐτῶν: καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτούς. 
[22] οἱ δὲ εὐθέως ἀφέντες τὸ πλοῖον καὶ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ. 

[23] Καὶ περιῆγεν ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ, διδάσκων ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς αὐτῶν καὶ κηρύσσων τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς βασιλείας καὶ θεραπεύων πᾶσαν νόσον καὶ πᾶσαν μαλακίαν ἐν τῷ λαῷ. 
[24] καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἡ ἀκοὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς ὅλην τὴν Συρίαν: καὶ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ πάντας τοὺς κακῶς ἔχοντας ποικίλαις νόσοις καὶ βασάνοις συνεχομένους [καὶ] δαιμονιζομένους καὶ σεληνιαζομένους καὶ παραλυτικούς, καὶ ἐθεράπευσεν αὐτούς. 
[25] καὶ ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ ὄχλοι πολλοὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας καὶ Δεκαπόλεως καὶ Ἱεροσολύμων καὶ Ἰουδαίας καὶ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου.

## Collect

Almighty and everlasting God, mercifully look upon our infirmities and stretch forth the hand of Your majesty to heal and defend us; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Prayer for the Country

Holy Father, as Your People, we turn to You, our only refuge in every need. You see how confused and concerned our nation is. Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy!

Show us the path forward that we, our elected leaders, and those who have authority over us may be faithful in the vocations you have given us to do. Cause us to be uncompromising witnesses to Your will and Your ways, both in our homes and in the public square.

Help us to proclaim in Christ the gift of forgiveness for every sin we have committed, every time we have not spoken the truth in love, every instance where we have not taken action in accord with the truth of Your Holy Word. Give us a voice to speak for the unborn, the joy to lift up the gift of marriage, and the willingness to speak on behalf of people of faith who are, even now, persecuted for their faith in You.

We have no right to ask this, save through the merits and meditation of Him whose blood atones for the sin of the whole world, even Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, Jesus was baptized, *[Point to window]* and the heavens were opened, and the Father's voice was heard: **“This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased”** [(Mt 3:17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+3/). The Spirit desceneded like a dove and came to rest on Him.
Beloved in the Lord, the sinless Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world was baptized with sinners on that day---you may call it the inauguration day for Christ's earthly minstry---the sinless Lamb of God was inaugurated by John the Baptist who was preaching serious repentance and a washing away of sins, and here comes the Savior, with no sin to repent of, saying, “Baptize me, too. It may seem confusing, John, but baptize me, too, *with* sinners for I have come to work *for* sinners.”
That is very good news for us sinners.
The light of Christ surely shined that day, though, with the Father and the Holy Spirit making a public appearance at the inauguration of Jesus, the Son of God, who comes to work for sinners.

He went straight to work, being led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan for 40 days.
And our Lord Jesus held up under Satan's tempting---though hungry, He did not turn the stones to bread because Satan told Him to---though the angels were protecting Him, He did not throw Himself down from the pinnacle of the temple because Satan told Him to---though Jesus had come as King, He was not enticed to fall down and worship Satan as Satan told Him to.
At every turn, Satan's lies were refuted by the Word of God---at every turn, Satan's lies were refuted by the Word of God *made flesh*---our dear Lord Jesus.
That was Christ's first act of office, though, when He was tempted in the wilderness by Satan.

Jesus got started as the bright, shining Light of the World, as we believe Him to be.
Yet when He began to teach in the synagogues, He went back to Nazareth, His hometown. **All spoke well of Him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from His mouth** [(Lk 4:22)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4/)---the light of Christ shines---but then they said, **“Is this not Joseph's son?”**
They did not believe in Him. They did not believe that the Scriptures testify about Him.
In His own hometown of Nazareth **they rose up and drove Him out of the town and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could _throw Him down the cliff_**.

Though Jesus shines as light in the darkness---He boldly shines wherever He goes---though Jesus casts away the darkness manufactured when Satan lies because He comes to us as the Word of God made flesh---what a wonderful thing to have a Savior from Satan who throws down all that the devil's lies have built!
Though Jesus does shine in the darkness all the time, every time, *watch out for unbelief*.
God forbid, but by unbelief, you may not remain indifferent to Jesus, you may hate Him.
Take the lesson leaned at Nazareth.
Though at one point they marveled at His gracious words, their unbelief led them to try to _throw Him down the cliff_.

So, though Jesus shines from the get‑go in His earthly ministry, unbelief steps onto the stage---unbelief, with its terrible consequences.
**“I believe; help my unbelief!”** (Mk 9:24 ESV).

Jesus left His hometown and went to Capernaum.
There He found the first four of who would become His twelve apostles: Peter, Andrew, John, and James.
To Peter and Andrew He said, **“Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”**
From there He called John and James, and **immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him**.
Here we simply have a picture of faith to contrast against the unbelief of the people in Jesus' hometown.
You already know something about what the faith of Peter and Andrew, James and John came to; all four would remain faithful apostles.
Peter denied Jesus three times, but in the end was entrusted with feeding Jesus' sheep.
John 6:8-9
Andrew, on a day when there were too many followers of Jesus to feed, said to him, **“There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many?”** (Jn 6:8).
And our Lord showed Him what He can do with five loaves and two fish!
John wrote the Gospel of John.
And James was put to death for being a faithful apostle of Jesus (Ac 12:2).

When Jesus says, **“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,”** you can take it in two ways.

1. Repent because you will be punished if you do not.
1. Repent because Jesus came for sinners; He has no opportunity to serve you if you do not repent.

May the Holy Spirit preserve us *in faith*, AMEN.
