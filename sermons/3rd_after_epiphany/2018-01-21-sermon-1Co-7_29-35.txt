## Old Testament [Jnh 3:1‑5, 10 ESV]

[1] Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying, [2] “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it the message that I tell you.” [3] So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, three days' journey in breadth. [4] Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” [5] And the people of Nineveh believed God. They called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.

[10] When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.

## Epistle [1Co 7:29‑35 ESV; sermon text]

[29] This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, [30] and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, [31] and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.

[32] I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. [33] But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, [34] and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. [35] I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.

[29] τοῦτο δέ φημι, ἀδελφοί, ὁ καιρὸς συνεσταλμένος ἐστίν: τὸ λοιπὸν ἵνα καὶ οἱ ἔχοντες γυναῖκας ὡς μὴ ἔχοντες ὦσιν, 
[30] καὶ οἱ κλαίοντες ὡς μὴ κλαίοντες, καὶ οἱ χαίροντες ὡς μὴ χαίροντες, καὶ οἱ ἀγοράζοντες ὡς μὴ κατέχοντες, 
[31] καὶ οἱ χρώμενοι τὸν κόσμον ὡς μὴ καταχρώμενοι: παράγει γὰρ τὸ σχῆμα τοῦ κόσμου τούτου. 

[32] θέλω δὲ ὑμᾶς ἀμερίμνους εἶναι. ὁ ἄγαμος μεριμνᾷ τὰ τοῦ κυρίου, πῶς ἀρέσῃ τῷ κυρίῳ: 
[33] ὁ δὲ γαμήσας μεριμνᾷ τὰ τοῦ κόσμου, πῶς ἀρέσῃ τῇ γυναικί, 
[34] καὶ μεμέρισται. καὶ ἡ γυνὴ ἡ ἄγαμος καὶ ἡ παρθένος μεριμνᾷ τὰ τοῦ κυρίου, ἵνα ᾖ ἁγία καὶ τῷ σώματι καὶ τῷ πνεύματι: ἡ δὲ γαμήσασα μεριμνᾷ τὰ τοῦ κόσμου, πῶς ἀρέσῃ τῷ ἀνδρί. 
[35] τοῦτο δὲ πρὸς τὸ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν σύμφορον λέγω, οὐχ ἵνα βρόχον ὑμῖν ἐπιβάλω, ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὸ εὔσχημον καὶ εὐπάρεδρον τῷ κυρίῳ ἀπερισπάστως.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 1:14‑20 ESV]

[14] Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, [15] and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”

[16] Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [17] And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” [18] And immediately they left their nets and followed him. [19] And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. [20] And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
We are in the middle of Epiphany where Christ is starting to shine.
Ash Wednesday is a few weeks off and, yes, Ash Wednesday is on Valentine's Day this year---do not forget to tell your sweetheart, "Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return."
(That will be an interesting midweek service.)
More than that, Easter in on April Fools Day this year.
And who is the fool when Christ is resurrected from the dead?
What an interesting Lenten season and Holy Week we have coming up, but we are not there yet---it is still Epiphany when Christ is starting to shine as God's Son and our Savior from sin.

Let us review some of the main events of Epiphany, because Christ starts to shine a lot.
Jesus is presented at the temple as an infant, and Simeon and Anna, full of the Holy Spirit, prophesy about this Child, that He is God's salvation and the Redeemer of Jerusalem.
As an infant, Jesus starts to shine as our Savior.

*[Point at the stained glass window.]* Twelve-year-old Jesus stays behind in the temple to discuss the Bible with the most learned men of the day, and they are amazed at His understanding and His answers [(Lk 2:47)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2/).
Jesus starts to shine that He is all about the Bible.
And instead of apologizing to His parents for not following them out of Jerusalem after the Passover feast, He tells them, **"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?"** [(Lk 2:49 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2/).
Jesus does return to Nazareth with Joseph and Mary and is submissive to them, but here Jesus starts to shine that His true Father is His Father in heaven.
All of this is part of Epiphany.
This is so nice that it could just as well be Epiphany all year long.

But it gets better.
My favorite part of Epiphany is the *[Point to the Baptism window.]* Baptism of Jesus.
(We certainly have an Epiphany-friendly sanctuary!)
John the Baptist is preaching *repentance*: "Stop sinning and fear the One who can throw both your body and soul in hell [(Mt 10:28)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+10/)!
**You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance [(Mt 3:7‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+3/).**"
John the Baptist is part of Epiphany; He is a big part of showing Jesus to us.
In fact, this is John's whole job: point at Jesus and say, **"Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"** [(Jn 1:29 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+1/).
The wonderful part of Jesus' Baptism to me is that He insists on being baptized with sinners even though He is without sin.
John knows this and says that Jesus should be baptizing him.
In Epiphany, Jesus shows that He is here for sinners---He is here for me---He is here for you.
It is one thing to be baptized *with* sinners, and another thing to be crucified *for* sinners.
Lent is coming up, beloved in the Lord, and so is *Good* Friday---very good for us sinners.

Beloved in the Lord, when you are done repenting of your sins and bearing fruit that shows that you forsake your sin, you need to know that the devil will be after you.
Beware, but be sure that Jesus is here for you.
And by the way, who am I and what am I to do?
I am your pastor, Jesus called me here to serve you.
He has given you His Holy Spirit and lives in your heart, and He has also given you *me*---your pastor---to watch over your soul.
It is in the Bible; that is what I am here for.
If the devil is after you, I want to know because Jesus put me here to serve you and strengthen you against the devil, and I *will* one day give an account to Jesus for how I served you [(Heb 13:17)](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+13/).

And then, of course, this is also part of Ephiphany: Jesus is tempted by Satan in the wilderness.
Do you want to see how it is done---how to stand up against the devil?
Cling to God's Word and do not let the devil twist it.
I would also add, "Cling to the name of Jesus, for His is the only name by which any man can stand against Satan."
The Second Commandment tells us not to use the Lord's name in vain, but *do* call upon the Lord's name when Satan is after you: "Help me, dear Lord Jesus, that I not sin as the devil is tempting me to do! Help me to cling to Your Word as you did when You were tempted in the wilderness. Amen."

But now, on a lighter note---and there is always a lighter note where Jesus is Lord---the wedding at Cana is also part of Ephiphany---Jesus' first miracle where He changes water to wine.
The lighter note is that there seems to be quite a wedding reception going on and the guests have drunk all wine.
Jesus has complete control over creation, and for Him it is a small thing to turn water into wine.
Jesus keeps the celebration going by turning lots of water into lots of wine.
But note that He performs this miracle as a favor at a *wedding*.
In Epiphany, Jesus shows that God is pleased with *marriage*.
*Our Lord blessed and honored marriage with His presence and first miracle at Cana in Galilee.*[^1]

[^1]: *LSB Pastoral Care Companion*, 64.

Now at this point, please lend your attention to today's Epistle reading from 1 Corinthians, chapter 7.
It is about marriage.

> **I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband.**

Yes, marriage *is* a holy estate---there is no sin in being married.
In fact, St. Paul points out in the same chapter that marriage can serve to keep you from sinning---to keep you from committing sexual immorality.
But, have you ever considered *staying single and chaste* in order to devote yourself more fully to the Lord?
It is in the Bible---it is in today's Epistle reading.
If you have the gift of chastity---if you are blessed to be able to keep your body in control and refrain from sexual immorality---there is a lot the Lord has for you to do.
If you do not have this gift, then you better get married and spend a lot of time worrying about how to please your wife or husband.
That is the point St. Paul makes in our Epistle reading today.

What a novel thing it is even to suggest that today.
For Satan sells sexual immorality as a good and normal thing and if it gets you in trouble, terminate the pregnancy---get an abortion.
He will never, ever suggest truly staying chaste and serving the Lord, but by the grace of the Holy Spirit it is done all the time.
Do not listen to Satan: he is the father of lies!
Do not listen to the world!
You are far better off listening to God.
If you are able to stay under control and refrain from sexual immorality, you may just want to serve in Christ's Church as a single, chaste person.
The apostle Paul did, and many people do today.

*[Illustration]* As a matter of fact, we used to have such a person living down the street.
This brings up the subject of Roman Catholic monks and nuns.
This was a huge issue during the Reformation because living as a monk or nun was sold as a more certain way to heaven.
Nowhere does the Bible teach that!
The certain way to heaven is to believe that Jesus saves your from your sins by His bloody death on the Cross.
Jesus saves you; He does it all! Believe it and you have it apart from your works.
Now with regard to monks and nuns and priests it is also well-known that in the Roman Catholic Church there has been terrible sexual immorality because men, in particular, have been forbidden to marry who cannot keep their bodies under control.

But there are some who can.
One such woman used to live here on Behrwald, Diane.
I saw an older woman one day shoveling snow and what did I do?
I went over to help, for which she was grateful.
I later visited her at the Deaconess Krafft Center and listened to her and began to get a picture of what it is like to live as an unmarried, chaste Christian.
She told me that she would still want to be a nun if she had to do it again.
She was turning blind with no husband or family to care for her,
so she moved to Dayton, where she now lives with other Sisters of the Precious Blood.
It can be done: it is possible to stay single and serve the Lord.
Satan does not want you to know and the world will never tell you, but there are people all around who stay single and serve the Lord.
Jesus can come into the world and starts to shine.
Have Jesus in your heart and you will shine, too.
AMEN.
