## Old Testament [1Ki 17:17-24 ESV]
[17] After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. [18] And she said to Elijah, “What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son!” [19] And he said to her, “Give me your son.” And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged, and laid him on his own bed. [20] And he cried to the Lord, “O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?” [21] Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the Lord, “O Lord my God, let this child's life come into him again.” [22] And the Lord listened to the voice of Elijah. And the life of the child came into him again, and he revived. [23] And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, “See, your son lives.” [24] And the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.”

	
## Epistle [Gal 1:11-24 ESV; sermon text]
[11] For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. [12] For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. [13] For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. [14] And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. [15] But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, [16] was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; [17] nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
[18] Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. [19] But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. [20] (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) [21] Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. [22] And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. [23] They only were hearing it said, “He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” [24] And they glorified God because of me.


## Holy Gospel [Lk 7:11-17 ESV]
[11] Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him. [12] As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her. [13] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, “Do not weep.” [14] Then he came up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, arise.” [15] And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. [16] Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and “God has visited his people!” [17] And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.


## Introit [Ps 138:3, 7-8; antiphon: Ps. 86:??]
Turn to me and be gra- | cious to me;*
give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your maid- | servant.
On the day I called, you | answered me;*
my strength of soul | you increased.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you pre- | serve my life;*
you stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand de- | livers me.
The LORD will fulfill his pur- | pose for me;*
your steadfast love, O LORD, endures forever. Do not forsake the work | of your hands.


## Collect
O Lord,
Father of all mercy and God of all comfort,
You always go before and follow after us.
Grant that we may rejoice in Your gracious presence
and continually be given to all good works;
through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord,
who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and forever.
