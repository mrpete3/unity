## Old Testament [Gn 3:8‑15 ESV]

[8] And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. [9] But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” [10] And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.” [11] He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” [12] The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.” [13] Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

[14] The LORD God said to the serpent,

> “Because you have done this,\
> cursed are you above all livestock\
> and above all beasts of the field;\
> on your belly you shall go,\
> and dust you shall eat\
> all the days of your life.\
> [15] I will put enmity between you and the woman,\
> and between your offspring and her offspring;\
> he shall bruise your head,\
> and you shall bruise his heel.”

## Epistle [2Co 4:13‑5:1 ESV; sermon text]

[13] Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, “I believed, and so I spoke,” we also believe, and so we also speak, [14] knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. [15] For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.

[16] So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. [17] For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, [18] as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

[1] For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

[14] ἔχοντες δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ πνεῦμα τῆς πίστεως, κατὰ τὸ γεγραμμένον, Ἐπίστευσα, διὸ ἐλάλησα, καὶ ἡμεῖς πιστεύομεν, διὸ καὶ λαλοῦμεν, 
[15] εἰδότες ὅτι ὁ ἐγείρας τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν καὶ ἡμᾶς σὺν Ἰησοῦ ἐγερεῖ καὶ παραστήσει σὺν ὑμῖν. 
[16] τὰ γὰρ πάντα δι' ὑμᾶς, ἵνα ἡ χάρις πλεονάσασα διὰ τῶν πλειόνων τὴν εὐχαριστίαν περισσεύσῃ εἰς τὴν δόξαν τοῦ θεοῦ. 

[17] Διὸ οὐκ ἐγκακοῦμεν, ἀλλ' εἰ καὶ ὁ ἔξω ἡμῶν ἄνθρωπος διαφθείρεται, ἀλλ' ὁ ἔσω ἡμῶν ἀνακαινοῦται ἡμέρᾳ καὶ ἡμέρᾳ. 
[18] τὸ γὰρ παραυτίκα ἐλαφρὸν τῆς θλίψεως ἡμῶν καθ' ὑπερβολὴν εἰς ὑπερβολὴν αἰώνιον βάρος δόξης κατεργάζεται ἡμῖν, 
[19] μὴ σκοπούντων ἡμῶν τὰ βλεπόμενα ἀλλὰ τὰ μὴ βλεπόμενα: τὰ γὰρ βλεπόμενα πρόσκαιρα, τὰ δὲ μὴ βλεπόμενα αἰώνια.

[1] Οἴδαμεν γὰρ ὅτι ἐὰν ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ, οἰκοδομὴν ἐκ θεοῦ ἔχομεν οἰκίαν ἀχειροποίητον αἰώνιον ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 3:20‑35 ESV]

[20] Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. [21] And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.”

[22] And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.” [23] And he called them to him and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan? [24] If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. [25] And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. [26] And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. [27] But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house.

[28] “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, [29] but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—[30] for they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”

[31] And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. [32] And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you.” [33] And he answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” [34] And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! [35] For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.”

## Introit [Ps 28:7-9; antiphon: Ps 28:6]

> Blessed | be the LORD!\*\
> for he has heard the voice of my pleas for | mercy.\
> The LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and | I am helped;\*\
> my heart exults, and with my song I give | thanks to him.\
> The LORD is the strength of his | people;\*\
> he is the saving refuge of his a- | nointed.\
> Oh, save your people and bless your | heritage!\*\
> Be their shepherd and carry them for- | ever.\

## Collect

Almighty and eternal God, Your Son Jesus triumphed over the prince of demons and freed us from bondage to sin. Help us to stand firm against every assault of Satan, and enable us always to do Your will; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Many preachers and teachers bring up God---it is hard to get an audience and not mention God.
"I trusted God to give me a thousand bucks and he gave me a million. The reason you don't have enough money is you don't believe enough."
But they have to bring up God's name for people to listen to them.
And people do listen and people, by and large, do believe in God---that He exists and that He helps those who trust Him.

But the devil is in the details.
What happens when you start getting specific, like mentioning the name of Jesus?
What happens if you *teach specifically* that 
**"there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved"** [(Ac 4:12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+4:12/)?
*Specificity*---does God reveal anything *in detail*?
In the Bible He does.
The Bible reveales a lot of things with specificity, like you should stay away from mediums and fortune-tellers:

> **There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD.** [(Dt 18:10‑12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+18:10/)

In fact, if you do visit a fortune teller, you are in the same league with someone who sacrifices his own child as an offering---puts his own child to death as a sacrifice to an idol---horrible---an abomination to the Lord!
The Bible is specific.
If you can get rid of the Bible or just nudge it aside and let man's own ideas, even man's good intentions, creep in, you begin to say things that are easier for people to hear.
"Maybe God wants to teach us through fortune tellers" sounds like a tolerant thing to say---something easier for people to hear.
Not that I am bringing up fortune tellers as an example: I know of three fortune tellers who practice in our community: two on State Road and one on Memphis, and I remember going into the one on Memphis and inviting the fortune teller to bring her child to VBS.
Fortune telling is an abomination to God! This is the truth straight from the mouth of God.
And you may get the idea that "Pastor, did you have to say it that way?"
Yes, because the God says it that way in the Bible.

Oh, if we could just break loose from the Bible like the ELCA has.
"Pastor, did you have to say it that way?"
Well, you have a point there, because there is no mention of the ELCA and the Missouri Synod in the Bible, but this issue hits home.
Our own congregation split in the 1970's over the issue of how to interpret the Bible.
At that time, the ELCA was taken over by something called the historical-critical method of interpreting the Bible and it also infiltrated The Lutheran Church---Missouri Synod.
Not to bore you, but I think it is important for you to know that the historical-critical method originated in Europe and spread to North America in the 1900's through what was taught at universities.
It was taught at universities and then came to our seminaries.
It is really not a bad idea: try to understand the best you can the historical context---the historical situation in which the Bible was written and then interpret the Bible according to what you learned about the history.
This is the historical-critical method of interpreting the Bible.
You can certainly try to understand history the best you can with good intentions.
*But here is the catch*: when the historical-critical method *played out*, it placed _[Show high]_ man's reason up here, and _[Show low]_ *specific teachings* of the Bible down here.
Let me give you an example: Jonah was swallowed by a whale.
Maybe he was swallowed by another great sea creature, but *it is written*,

> **And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.** [(Jnh 1:17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Jonah+1:17/)

When the historical-critical method played out, there were many teachers of the Bible who concluded that Jonah is a symbolic story and that Jonah was not literally swallowed by the great fish and Jonah did not literally spend three days and three nights in the fish's belly.
"Can't we be Christians and disagree on this interpretation?"

Beloved in the Lord, listen to what Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount:

> **"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished."** [(Mt 5:17‑18 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5:17/)

Jesus is not here to change *anything*, not even the punctuation, of the Bible, but to *accomplish it*---to *fulfill it*.
Now listen to what our Lord says about Jonah.

> **"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."** [(Mt 12:39‑40 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+12:39/) 

Jesus does not play games with Jonah: Jonah was literally three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish as a figure of Christ's own three days and three nights in the heart of the earth after He died on the Cross bearing our sins!
The point is that if you, with good intentions, apply the historical-critical method to God's Word to the point that you do not believe that Jonah was really swallowed by the great fish and really spent three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, what do you then believe about Christ being dead and buried for three days?
If you do not believe that Jonah was vomited by the great fish back onto land, what do you then believe about Christ's Resurrection from the dead?
Without Christ's Resurrection from the dead, our faith is useless and we are to be pitied more than all people.

> **Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and _you are still in your sins_. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.** [(1Co 15:12‑19 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+15:12/)

If there is not resurrection of the dead, who is pleased that you are still in your sins?
*Satan.*
Again, the Bible specifically teaches that Satan is the serpent in the Garden of Eden [(Rv 12:9)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+12:9/) who deceived Eve to believe that you cannot trust what God says [(Gn 3:1‑5)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:1/).
And there, beloved in the Lord, is the issue: *what God says*.
*What God says* is the focus of Satan's efforts.
If there is a Bible teacher out there who shies away from Satan as if he does not exist, as if he does not have us in a stranglehold without Jesus, hear this:
**"The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil"** [(1Jn 3:8b ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+3:8/).

And who, when he tempted our Lord for forty days and forty nights in the wilderness, tried to interpret the Bible in his own, twisted way [(Lk 4:1‑13)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4:1/)?
The devil.
The Bible specifically teaches that the devil is real, that He was a murderer from the beginning and is the father of lies [(Jn 8:44)](https://www.esv.org/John+8:44/).
The Bible specifically teaches that the devil would have you *not trust what God has plainly said*.
When he tempted Christ, even then He tried to twist the Scriptures---to interpret them in a different, deceptive way.
Witness the interpretation of Jonah by the historical-critical method.

And the Bible specifically teaches that after being tempted by the devil, Jesus freely cast out demons.

When did Jesus bind Satan?
The Bible specifically teaches that Satan entering Judas started the events of our Lord's Passion and Crucifixion.
Where do we see Satan bound up and no longer to harm us?
When Jesus dies, he trusts His Father and becomes the atonement for our sins.

His Resurrection validates that atonement.
His Resurrection validates everything He taught.
His Resurrection validates His claim to be God.
His Resurrection validates that *we are no longer in our sins*, and if we are no longer in our sins, then the devil has nothing more to accuse us for.
His work over us is finished.

AMEN.
