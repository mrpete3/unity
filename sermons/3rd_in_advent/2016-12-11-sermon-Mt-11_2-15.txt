> [1] The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad;\
> the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus;\
> [2] it shall blossom abundantly\
> and rejoice with joy and singing.\

> the majesty of our God.

> [3] Strengthen the weak hands,\
> and make firm the feeble knees.\

> with the recompense of God.\
> He will come and save you.”

> and streams in the desert;\
> [7] the burning sand shall become a pool,\
> and the thirsty ground springs of water;\
> in the haunt of jackals, where they lie down,\

## Epistle [Jas 5:7‑11 ESV]

[7] Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains. [8] You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. [9] Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door. [10] As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. [11] Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 11:2‑15 ESV; sermon text]

[2] Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples [3] and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?” [4] And Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: [5] the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. [6] And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.”

[7] As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? [8] What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. [9] What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. [10] This is he of whom it is written,

> “‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\
> who will prepare your way before you.’

[11] Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. [12] From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. [13] For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, [14] and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. [15] He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, our Holy Gospel starts with these words:
**&ldquo;Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, &lsquo;Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?&rsquo;&rdquo;**
Imagine *you* were John the Baptist.
Imagine yourself thrown in jail for saying the right thing.
John had called out King Herod for committing adultery with his brother's wife: that is what landed him in prison.
Imagine you were thrown in jail for protesting in front of an abortion chamber, crying out for the right of an unborn child to live.
You stood up and said the right thing and were thrown in jail for it.

So, if you were thrown in jail for doing the right thing, would you think that God had forgotten you?
Maybe you would, and some may think that John the Baptist was depressed in Herod's prison wondering whether Jesus was real---whether Jesus was really the Messiah whose way John the Baptist had come to prepare.
However, I suggest to you today that John the Baptist was not depressed at all---sitting in jail to ultimately be beheaded by the guile of Herodias, Herod's wife.
How *could* he be depressed?
*[Point to Baptism window]*
_For John had baptized Jesus_ and saw heaven open, and heard the Father say, **&ldquo;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased&rdquo;** [(Mt 3:17)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%203%3A17/).
John saw the Holy Spirit descend as a dove on Jesus.
No matter what John suffered for doing the right thing, I cannot imagine that, after baptizing Jesus and being in the heavenly presence of the Holy Trinity---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---I cannot imagine that he doubted at all.
I believe John the Baptist was full of *[Point to pink Advent candle]* *Advent joy* right up to when Herod's executioner beheaded him.
For John had seen Jesus come with his own eyes and he *knew* Jesus was the Messiah.

So why, then, did John send his disciples to see Jesus?

> **He sent word by his disciples and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?&rdquo;**

He sent his disciples not because he needed to believe in Jesus, but because *he wanted his disciples see Jesus and follow Jesus*.
And to John's disciples and to you and to anyone who would be better off following Jesus, He answers,

> **&ldquo;Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.&rdquo;**

Jesus tells John's disciples, &ldquo;Listen to what was foretold by the Old Testament prophets and then look at Me.&rdquo;
Take Isaiah, for example:

> **Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,**\
> **and the ears of the deaf unstopped;**\
> **then shall the lame man leap like a deer,**\
> **and the tongue of the mute sing for joy.** [(Is&nbsp;35:5&#x2011;6 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2035%3A5-6/)

And again, listen to Isaiah:

> **For to us a child is born, to us a son is given;**\
> **and the government shall be upon his shoulder,**\
> **and his name shall be called**\
> **Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,**\
> **Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.** [(Is&nbsp;9:6 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%209%3A6/)

And listen what was foretold by the prophet Micah:

> **But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,**\
> **who are too little to be among the clans of Judah,**\
> **from you shall come forth for me**\
> **one who is to be ruler in Israel,**\
> **whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.**\
> **&hellip; And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD,**\
> **&hellip; And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great**\
> **to the ends of the earth.**\
> **And he shall be their peace.** [(Mi&nbsp;5:2, 4&#x2011;5 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Micah%205%3A2/)

You and I have not had the pleasure of seeing Jesus face to face, but consider the *name* of Jesus---where it has been proclaimed and believed for the forgiveness of sins.
Is there peace where the name of Jesus is believed for the forgivness of sins?

Listen to what was foretold by the prophet Jeremiah:

> **&ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, &hellip; They shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.&rdquo;** [(Jer&nbsp;31:31, 34 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Jeremiah%2031%3A31-34/)

Is there peace where God remembers our sin no more?
*There is peace and nothing but peace.*
There is ample evidence throughout the world of the work of Jesus.
Go and see where His name is preached for the forgiveness of sins.
Go and see, especially, where His name is *believed* for the forgiveness of sins.
Go and see where two or three are gathered in Jesus' name and *there you will see enough* to know that what the prophets foretold has been fulfilled in Jesus.
The only question is: Are you offended by Jesus?
It is best that you not be offended by Him, for He is your Savior from sin, death, and hell.
Are you not offended by Jesus? Do you rejoice in Jesus? You are blessed.
AMEN.
