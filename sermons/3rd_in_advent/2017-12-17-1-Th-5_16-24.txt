## Old Testament [Is 61:1‑4, 8‑11 ESV]

> [1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,\
> because the LORD has anointed me\
> to bring good news to the poor;\
> he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,\
> to proclaim liberty to the captives,\
> and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;\
> [2] to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor,\
> and the day of vengeance of our God;\
> to comfort all who mourn;\
> [3] to grant to those who mourn in Zion—\
> to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,\
> the oil of gladness instead of mourning,\
> the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;\
> that they may be called oaks of righteousness,\
> the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.\
> [4] They shall build up the ancient ruins;\
> they shall raise up the former devastations;\
> they shall repair the ruined cities,\
> the devastations of many generations.

> [8] For I the LORD love justice;\
> I hate robbery and wrong;\
> I will faithfully give them their recompense,\
> and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\
> [9] Their offspring shall be known among the nations,\
> and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;\
> all who see them shall acknowledge them,\
> that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.

> [10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;\
> my soul shall exult in my God,\
> for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;\
> he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,\
> as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,\
> and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.\
> [11] For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,\
> and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,\
> so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise\
> to sprout up before all the nations.

## Epistle [1Th 5:16‑24 ESV; sermon text]

[16] Rejoice always, [17] pray without ceasing, [18] give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. [19] Do not quench the Spirit. [20] Do not despise prophecies, [21] but test everything; hold fast what is good. [22] Abstain from every form of evil.

[23] Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. [24] He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.

[16] Πάντοτε χαίρετε, 
[17] ἀδιαλείπτως προσεύχεσθε, 
[18] ἐν παντὶ εὐχαριστεῖτε: τοῦτο γὰρ θέλημα θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς. 
[19] τὸ πνεῦμα μὴ σβέννυτε, 
[20] προφητείας μὴ ἐξουθενεῖτε: 
[21] πάντα δὲ δοκιμάζετε, τὸ καλὸν κατέχετε, 
[22] ἀπὸ παντὸς εἴδους πονηροῦ ἀπέχεσθε. 

[23] Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης ἁγιάσαι ὑμᾶς ὁλοτελεῖς, καὶ ὁλόκληρον ὑμῶν τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ καὶ τὸ σῶμα ἀμέμπτως ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τηρηθείη. 
[24] πιστὸς ὁ καλῶν ὑμᾶς, ὃς καὶ ποιήσει.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 1:6‑8, 19‑28 ESV]

[6] There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. [7] He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. [8] He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

[19] And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” [20] He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” [21] And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” [22] So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”

[24] (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) [25] They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” [26] John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, [27] even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” [28] These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

## Introit [Ps 85:8-9, 12-13; antiphon: Ps 85:7]

> Show us your steadfast love, | O Lord,\*\
> and grant us your sal- | vation.\
> Let me hear what God the | LORD will speak,\*\
> for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints; but let them not turn back to | folly.\
> Surely his salvation is near to those who | fear him,\*\
> that glory may dwell | in our land.\
> Yes, the LORD will give | what is good,\*\
> and our land will yield its | increase.\
> Righteousness will go be- | fore him\*\
> and make his foot- | steps a way.\
