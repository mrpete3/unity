## Old Testament [Is 61:1‑4, 8‑11 ESV]

> [1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,\
> because the LORD has anointed me\
> to bring good news to the poor;\
> he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,\
> to proclaim liberty to the captives,\
> and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;\
> [2] to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor,\
> and the day of vengeance of our God;\
> to comfort all who mourn;\
> [3] to grant to those who mourn in Zion—\
> to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,\
> the oil of gladness instead of mourning,\
> the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;\
> that they may be called oaks of righteousness,\
> the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.\
> [4] They shall build up the ancient ruins;\
> they shall raise up the former devastations;\
> they shall repair the ruined cities,\
> the devastations of many generations.

> [8] For I the LORD love justice;\
> I hate robbery and wrong;\
> I will faithfully give them their recompense,\
> and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\
> [9] Their offspring shall be known among the nations,\
> and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;\
> all who see them shall acknowledge them,\
> that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.

> [10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;\
> my soul shall exult in my God,\
> for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;\
> he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,\
> as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,\
> and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.\
> [11] For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,\
> and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,\
> so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise\
> to sprout up before all the nations.

## Epistle [1Th 5:16‑24 ESV; sermon text]

[16] Rejoice always, [17] pray without ceasing, [18] give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. [19] Do not quench the Spirit. [20] Do not despise prophecies, [21] but test everything; hold fast what is good. [22] Abstain from every form of evil.

[23] Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. [24] He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.

[16] Πάντοτε χαίρετε, 
[17] ἀδιαλείπτως προσεύχεσθε, 
[18] ἐν παντὶ εὐχαριστεῖτε: τοῦτο γὰρ θέλημα θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς. 
[19] τὸ πνεῦμα μὴ σβέννυτε, 
[20] προφητείας μὴ ἐξουθενεῖτε: 
[21] πάντα δὲ δοκιμάζετε, τὸ καλὸν κατέχετε, 
[22] ἀπὸ παντὸς εἴδους πονηροῦ ἀπέχεσθε. 

[23] Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης ἁγιάσαι ὑμᾶς ὁλοτελεῖς, καὶ ὁλόκληρον ὑμῶν τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ καὶ τὸ σῶμα ἀμέμπτως ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τηρηθείη. 
[24] πιστὸς ὁ καλῶν ὑμᾶς, ὃς καὶ ποιήσει.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 1:6‑8, 19‑28 ESV]

[6] There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. [7] He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. [8] He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

[19] And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” [20] He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” [21] And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” [22] So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”

[24] (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) [25] They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” [26] John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, [27] even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” [28] These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

> and shall not be | put to shame.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
If there is a holiday for joy, today is it.
There are many reasons to be happy, and we should count our blessings every day, but the church calendar sets aside today, the Third Sunday in Advent, for *joy*.
Behold the pink candle in the Advent wreath---it is pink for *joy*.

> **Rejoice always.**

And, boy, do we have reason to rejoice, for Jesus is ours.
We also belong to Jesus---this is true---we belong to Jesus because He is our Good Shepherd and we are His sheep.
But today, let us ponder that Jesus belongs to *us*---He is, without trying to wear it out---the greatest Christmas gift ever---for each one of us.
Darnell Brazell, by the way, has written a nice poem about this, and I will now pick up this theme and preach it.

If you have nothing under the tree, you still have Jesus and you can still rejoice.
But if you *do* have a present under the tree, that is really nice.
Someone has thought of you---someone has gone to the trouble to think of you and find a present and wrap it and put it under the tree *just for you*.
Winnie Rathbun makes and sells jewelry, as you know, but she calls her business _Handmade by Me **4 U**_.
To know that someone has made something *just for you*---to know that someone has put a present under the tree *just for you* means *you're special*.
These make some of the best memories of your life.

Jesus, however, is more of a present *just for us* than He is a present *just for you*, because we all need Him.
He is God's present for us---a wrapped present wrapped in
the prophecies of the Old Testament. And here is just one of them.
The Lord announced to Moses,

> **"I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him."** [(Dt 18:18‑19 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+18/)

This is the famous Old-Testament wrapping: the promise of *the Prophet*
The Lord announced to Moses that He would raise up for the Israelites another prophet like Moses.
Moses is the old and the Prophet will be the new.
The Israelites were promised this new Prophet not when life was great and they were relaxing---they were promised the Prophet when they were traveling through the wilderness to the Promised Land and life was not great, or so they thought.
The Israelites were promised the Prophet not when they were doing great and God was pleased with them.
The spies---do you remember?---the spies had gone to the Promised Land---"We're almost there! Go, check it out."
When the spies returned, they brought back a cluster of grapes hanging on a pole and a report that there is food in the Promised Land but the people who live there are giants---they will sqash us.
The Israelites were close to reaching the Promised Land but were afraid and wanted to turn back to Egypt---they were afraid of being attacked [(Nm 13‑14)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+13/).
They did not trust that God would bring them safely into the land He had promised them.

Of course, they had good reason to be afraid of God, for they had made a golden calf and worshiped it.
They had seen those tablets of the Ten Commandments shattered in Moses' anger at the calf.
They were idolaters and and were afraid because they knew that God destroys idolaters.
It was not that God spoke and Moses transcribed the Commandments onto the stone with a hammer and chisel: *God Himself* wrote His Commandments on the stone so that the people would know how to live right before God.
This holy transaction was going on on the mountain of God and the people were not at the bottom of the mountain prayinig and praising God---they were committing shameful acts around the golden calf.
Yet on the mountain, God wrote these holy Commands on the stone tablets:

> **You shall have no other gods.**\
> **You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God.**\
> **Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.**\
> **Honor your father and your mother.**\
> **You shall not murder.**\
> **You shall not commit adultery.**\
> **You shall not steal.**\
> **You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.**\
> **You shall not covet your neighbor's house.**\
> **You shall not covet your neightbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.**

Oh yes, the Ten Commandments have a lot to do with Christmas!
God wrote these Commandments with His own finger on the stone tablets that we would live by them!
We know they are right---no one even questions if they are right---this is how to live right before God.

The Israelites were terrified because these Commandments did not help them to live right.
Though the Commandments *are* right, they have no power to *make us* live right.
*Live by the rules* is right, but it does not work.
The Israelites had God's Law to know how to live a righteous life but *they could not do it*!
And they were afraid as they were on the day Moses broke the tablets.
Then God promised them the Prophet---the One they need not fear because of their guilt under God's holy Law.

At this point, beloved in the Lord, I hope that you recognize that you and I are no different from the Israelites.
None of us are right for having kept God's Law, for as soon as we break one of the Commandments, we are *guilty* before God and await His righteous wrath.
Try to better next time, and if all we have is our own efforts, we will only become more and more frustrated the next time we sin.
If all we have are the Commandments, we are condemned to die and go to hell.
Jesus comes wrapped in the promise that He is the Prophet of whom we need *not* be afraid, we need only listen to Him.

If you stand condemned under God's Law, you have a present this Christmas---a present you need, but I hope a present you also desperately want---the present of righeousness before God even though you have broken His Commandments.
Jesus is your present who comes not to condemn you under the Law, but to do whatever it takes to remove that condemnation from you.
When the condemnation is removed, you are, in fact, *righeous* before God---He thinks you do good and does not condemn you.
Receive that present in your heart and you will have, by far, the best Christmas present ever.
Rejoice in your Lord Jesus!
AMEN.
