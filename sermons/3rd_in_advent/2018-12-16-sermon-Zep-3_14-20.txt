## Old Testament [Zep 3:14‑20 ESV; sermon text]

Zephaniah 3:14–20

	[14] Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;
		shout, O Israel!
	Rejoice and exult with all your heart,
		O daughter of Jerusalem!
	[15] The LORD has taken away the judgments against you;
		he has cleared away your enemies.
	The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst;
		you shall never again fear evil.
	[16] On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
	“Fear not, O Zion;
		let not your hands grow weak.
	[17] The LORD your God is in your midst,
		a mighty one who will save;
	he will rejoice over you with gladness;
		he will quiet you by his love;
	he will exult over you with loud singing.
	[18] I will gather those of you who mourn for the festival,
		so that you will no longer suffer reproach.
	[19] Behold, at that time I will deal
		with all your oppressors.
	And I will save the lame
		and gather the outcast,
	and I will change their shame into praise
		and renown in all the earth.
	[20] At that time I will bring you in,
		at the time when I gather you together;
	for I will make you renowned and praised
		among all the peoples of the earth,
	when I restore your fortunes
		before your eyes,” says the LORD. (ESV)

## Epistle [Php 4:4‑7 ESV]

Philippians 4:4–7

[4] Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. [5] Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; [6] do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. [7] And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (ESV)

## Holy Gospel [Lk 7:18‑35 ESV]

Luke 7:18–35

[18] The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John, [19] calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?” [20] And when the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?’” [21] In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. [22] And he answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. [23] And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.”

[24] When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? [25] What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts. [26] What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. [27] This is he of whom it is written,

	“‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
		who will prepare your way before you.’
	
	
	[28] I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” [29] (When all the people heard this, and the tax collectors too, they declared God just, having been baptized with the baptism of John, [30] but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)

[31] “To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? [32] They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another,

	“‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;
		we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’
	
	
	[33] For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ [34] The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ [35] Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.” (ESV)
