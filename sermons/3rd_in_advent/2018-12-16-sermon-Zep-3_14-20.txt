## Old Testament [Zep 3:14‑20 ESV; sermon text]

> [14] Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;\
> shout, O Israel!\
> Rejoice and exult with all your heart,\
> O daughter of Jerusalem!\
> [15] The LORD has taken away the judgments against you;\

## Epistle [Php 4:4‑7 ESV]

[4] Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. [5] Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; [6] do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. [7] And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 7:18‑35 ESV]

[18] The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John, [19] calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?” [20] And when the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?’” [21] In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. [22] And he answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. [23] And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.”

[24] When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? [25] What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts. [26] What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. [27] This is he of whom it is written,

> “‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’
	
	
[28] "I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” [29] (When all the people heard this, and the tax collectors too, they declared God just, having been baptized with the baptism of John, [30] but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)

[31] “To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? [32] They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another,

> “‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’
	
	
[33] "For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ [34] The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ [35] Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.”

## Introit [Ps 99:99-99; antiphon: Ps 99:99]

> I will speak of your testimonies before kings, | [O Lord,]\*\
> and shall not be | put to shame.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Today, on the Third Sunday of Advent, there is no need to hold back---rejoice!
Light the pink candle and rejoice!
We are conditioned to respond at Christmastime.
It is Christmastime, so we buy things.
It is Christamastime, so we prepare meals and invite our family and friends to sit down together and eat.
It is Christmastime, and what amazes me the most is Christmas music.
It is Christmastime, and I hear Christmas music all the time, and I want to hear more.
And here, on the corner of Pearl and Behrwald, it is Christmastime, *[Point toward the house across the street]* and we have the house across the street.
It is Christmastime, and our neighbor's house is lit---how our neighbor's house brings me joy when it is lit up at Christmastime with the manger scene.
I have grown so attached to his lights that if he did not light them, Christmas would not be the same for me.
*[Point to the pink Advent candle]* It is Christmastime---it is the second-to-last Sunday before Christmas---and the pink candle is lit: When you see the pink Advent candle lit, rejoice!
When you see the the pink candle lit, it is time for joy.
Rejoice because Christ is coming, and He will bring to you the greatest possible joy in the forgiveness of your sins and in the destruction of your worthless idols.

We turn on this Gaudete Sunday---Rejoice Sunday---to the prophet Zephaniah.
(I do not get a chance to preach on Zephaniah very often.)

> **The LORD your God is in your midst,**\
> **a mighty one who will save;**\
> **_he_ will rejoice over _you_ with gladness;**\
> **he will quiet you by his love;**\
> **_he_ will exult over _you_ with loud singing.**

This verse from Zephaniah, chapter 3, reveals who is rejoicing, and it is not only you who are rejoicing.
God is rejoicing!
God is rejoicing *over you*, of all people!
How can it be that God is rejoicing over me, a poor miserable sinner?
Jesus Christ is coming, and *He* will rejoice over *you*.

Let me tell you that Zephaniah prophesied at the same time as the prophet Jeremiah, and he is no less condemning of idolatry than Jeremiah is.
In fact, Zephaniah beats on idolaters and declares God's punishment of idolaters like Jeremiah does.
There are passages in Jeremiah that I do not feel comfortable reading from the pulpit, where God describes his hatred of idolatry as sexual sin, but we do not hear such language from Zephaniah.
We do hear this, however:

> **“I will stretch out my hand against Judah**\
> **and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem;**\
> **and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal**\
> **and the name of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,**\
> **those who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens,**\
> **those who bow down and swear to the LORD _and yet swear by Milcom_,**\
> **those who have turned back from following the LORD,**\
> **who do not seek the LORD or inquire of him.”** ([Zep 1:4‑6](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+1:4/) ESV)

The LORD also declares by Zephaniah, **"I will punish the men who are complacent"** ([Zep 1:12](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+1:12/) ESV).
Christ's coming calls us not to be complacent toward idolatry.
The *priests* of Judah, of all people, are singled out.
They lead the worship in the temple---they **bow down and swear to the LORD**---**and yet they swear by Milcom**.
Milcom, in case you did not know this, is the same false god as Molech, who is worshiped by the Ammonites.
God makes the priests resposible for their own idolatry and also for the idolatry of the people whom they lead.
(You may have noticed that God even makes Adam responsible for the sin of Eve ([Rm 5:14](https://www.esv.org/Romans+5:14/)).)

Many idols are worshiped by the priests, and because of the poor leadership of the priests, the people worship these idols, too.
I will focus only and briefly on one of them: Milcom, also known as Molech, the abomination of the Ammonites.
Zephaniah prophesied during the reign of King Josiah, but going back many kings to Solomon, we learn that though Solomon asked for wisdom and was given great wisdom, he abandoned it late in life and married hundreds of wives and worshiped their false gods.
And one of these false gods was Molech; he even built a high place for Molech ([1Ki 11](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+11/) ESV).

Yet the true God of Israel had long ago told Moses, **"You shall not give any of your children to offer them to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the LORD"** ([Lv 18:21](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+18:21/) ESV).
Molech was the God to whom children were sacrificed.
Today, we have abortion, and it is a loving thing to point out---both for the sake of the children who would be born and to their parents---that a child is a child from conception, and God has called us to marriage and to the care and nurture of children.
Abortion is the sacrifice of children to a false god.
It happened in Zephaniah's day and it happens today.
You may have noticed a terrible headline from Indiana this week with regard to fornication, abortion, and murder,[^1] but I will stop here because it is Gaudete Sunday, and we *will* rejoice.

> **"On that day you shall not be put to shame**\
> **because of the deeds by which you have rebelled against me;**\
> **for then I will remove from your midst**\
> **your proudly exultant ones,**\
> **and you shall no longer be haughty in my holy mountain."** ([Zep 3:11](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+3:11/) ESV)
		
We rejoice because the day comes---and we know this to be the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ---when we shall *not* be put to shame because of the deeds by which we have rebelled against God.
I repeat, we shall *not* be put to shame, and God will remove all our idolatry.
So rejoice, and prepare to get rid of your idols.
Zephaniah emphasizes it, Jeremiah emphasizes it---God will remove all idolatry.
We will finally worship God in spirit and in truth ([Jn 4:23](https://www.esv.org/John+4:23/)) at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
From God's point of view, with the idols gone and we fearing, loving, and trusting in Him alone, *He* is the one rejoicing in *us*---He is a very happy heavnly Father.

Jesus comes to change our shame into praise ([Zep 3:19](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+3:19/)).
And so, He comes to handle our shame, handle our idolatry, handle our sin.
He will do the work, and we will receive the benefits of His work by faith.
Overwhelmed by our sin, let us loose our grip on our idols and turn our hands to hold to the hem of Jesus.
From Him you will here soft words of mercy like this:

> **“Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.”** ([Jn 8:10‑11](https://www.esv.org/John+8:10/) ESV)

And He will back these words up with own blood.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
