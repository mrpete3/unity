## Old Testament [Ex 17:1‑7 ESV]

[1] All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. [2] Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” [3] But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” [4] So Moses cried to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” [5] And the LORD said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. [6] Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. [7] And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”

## Epistle [Rm 5:1‑8 ESV]

[1] Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. [2] Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. [3] Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, [4] and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, [5] and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

[6] For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. [7] For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—[8] but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 4:5‑30, 39‑42 ESV; sermon text]

[5] So [Jesus] came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. [6] Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.

[7] A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”
[8] (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)
[9] The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
[10] Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”[^1]
[11] The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? [12] Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.”
[13] Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, [14] but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” [15] The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”

[^1]: Zec 14:8. *Living water* is described by living water flowing out of Jerusalem. However [Jn 7:37‑39](https://www.esv.org/John+7/) is *the* parallel passage to this one.

[16] Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”
[17] The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; [18] for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”
[19] The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. [20] Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.” [21] Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. [22] You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. [23] But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. [24] God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” [25] The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.” [26] Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.”

[27] Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?” [28] So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, [29] “Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?” [30] They went out of the town and were coming to him.

...

[39] Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.” [40] So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. [41] And many more believed because of his word. [42] They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.”

[5] ἔρχεται οὖν εἰς πόλιν τῆς Σαμαρείας λεγομένην Συχὰρ πλησίον τοῦ χωρίου ὃ ἔδωκεν Ἰακὼβ [τῷ] Ἰωσὴφ τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ: 
[6] ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ πηγὴ τοῦ Ἰακώβ. ὁ οὖν Ἰησοῦς κεκοπιακὼς ἐκ τῆς ὁδοιπορίας ἐκαθέζετο οὕτως ἐπὶ τῇ πηγῇ: ὥρα ἦν ὡς ἕκτη. 

[7] Ἔρχεται γυνὴ ἐκ τῆς Σαμαρείας ἀντλῆσαι ὕδωρ. λέγει αὐτῇ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Δός μοι πεῖν: 
[8] οἱ γὰρ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπεληλύθεισαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν, ἵνα τροφὰς ἀγοράσωσιν. 
[9] λέγει οὖν αὐτῷ ἡ γυνὴ ἡ Σαμαρῖτις, Πῶς σὺ Ἰουδαῖος ὢν παρ' ἐμοῦ πεῖν αἰτεῖς γυναικὸς Σαμαρίτιδος οὔσης; {οὐ γὰρ συγχρῶνται Ἰουδαῖοι Σαμαρίταις.} 
[10] ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ, Εἰ ᾔδεις τὴν δωρεὰν τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τίς ἐστιν ὁ λέγων σοι, Δός μοι πεῖν, σὺ ἂν ᾔτησας αὐτὸν καὶ ἔδωκεν ἄν σοι ὕδωρ ζῶν. 
[11] λέγει αὐτῷ [ἡ γυνή], Κύριε, οὔτε ἄντλημα ἔχεις καὶ τὸ φρέαρ ἐστὶν βαθύ: πόθεν οὖν ἔχεις τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ζῶν; 
[12] μὴ σὺ μείζων εἶ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν Ἰακώβ, ὃς ἔδωκεν ἡμῖν τὸ φρέαρ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἔπιεν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ θρέμματα αὐτοῦ; 
[13] ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ, Πᾶς ὁ πίνων ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος τούτου διψήσει πάλιν: 
[14] ὃς δ' ἂν πίῃ ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος οὗ ἐγὼ δώσω αὐτῷ, οὐ μὴ διψήσει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, ἀλλὰ τὸ ὕδωρ ὃ δώσω αὐτῷ γενήσεται ἐν αὐτῷ πηγὴ ὕδατος ἁλλομένου εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον. 
[15] λέγει πρὸς αὐτὸν ἡ γυνή, Κύριε, δός μοι τοῦτο τὸ ὕδωρ, ἵνα μὴ διψῶ μηδὲ διέρχωμαι ἐνθάδε ἀντλεῖν. 

[16] Λέγει αὐτῇ, Υπαγε φώνησον τὸν ἄνδρα σου καὶ ἐλθὲ ἐνθάδε. 
[17] ἀπεκρίθη ἡ γυνὴ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Οὐκ ἔχω ἄνδρα. λέγει αὐτῇ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Καλῶς εἶπας ὅτι Ἄνδρα οὐκ ἔχω: 
[18] πέντε γὰρ ἄνδρας ἔσχες, καὶ νῦν ὃν ἔχεις οὐκ ἔστιν σου ἀνήρ: τοῦτο ἀληθὲς εἴρηκας. 
[19] λέγει αὐτῷ ἡ γυνή, Κύριε, θεωρῶ ὅτι προφήτης εἶ σύ. 
[20] οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ προσεκύνησαν: καὶ ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις ἐστὶν ὁ τόπος ὅπου προσκυνεῖν δεῖ. 
[21] λέγει αὐτῇ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Πίστευέ μοι, γύναι, ὅτι ἔρχεται ὥρα ὅτε οὔτε ἐν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ οὔτε ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις προσκυνήσετε τῷ πατρί. 
[22] ὑμεῖς προσκυνεῖτε ὃ οὐκ οἴδατε: ἡμεῖς προσκυνοῦμεν ὃ οἴδαμεν, ὅτι ἡ σωτηρία ἐκ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐστίν. 
[23] ἀλλὰ ἔρχεται ὥρα, καὶ νῦν ἐστιν, ὅτε οἱ ἀληθινοὶ προσκυνηταὶ προσκυνήσουσιν τῷ πατρὶ ἐν πνεύματι καὶ ἀληθείᾳ: καὶ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ τοιούτους ζητεῖ τοὺς προσκυνοῦντας αὐτόν. 
[24] πνεῦμα ὁ θεός, καὶ τοὺς προσκυνοῦντας αὐτὸν ἐν πνεύματι καὶ ἀληθείᾳ δεῖ προσκυνεῖν. 
[25] λέγει αὐτῷ ἡ γυνή, Οἶδα ὅτι Μεσσίας ἔρχεται, ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός: ὅταν ἔλθῃ ἐκεῖνος, ἀναγγελεῖ ἡμῖν ἅπαντα. 
[26] λέγει αὐτῇ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἐγώ εἰμι, ὁ λαλῶν σοι. 

[27] Καὶ ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἦλθαν οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐθαύμαζον ὅτι μετὰ γυναικὸς ἐλάλει: οὐδεὶς μέντοι εἶπεν, Τί ζητεῖς; ἤ, Τί λαλεῖς μετ' αὐτῆς; 
[28] ἀφῆκεν οὖν τὴν ὑδρίαν αὐτῆς ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ λέγει τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, 
[29] Δεῦτε ἴδετε ἄνθρωπον ὃς εἶπέν μοι πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησα: μήτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστός; 
[30] ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἤρχοντο πρὸς αὐτόν.

...

[39] Ἐκ δὲ τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης πολλοὶ ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτὸν τῶν Σαμαριτῶν διὰ τὸν λόγον τῆς γυναικὸς μαρτυρούσης ὅτι Εἶπέν μοι πάντα ἃ ἐποίησα. 
[40] ὡς οὖν ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ Σαμαρῖται, ἠρώτων αὐτὸν μεῖναι παρ' αὐτοῖς: καὶ ἔμεινεν ἐκεῖ δύο ἡμέρας. 
[41] καὶ πολλῷ πλείους ἐπίστευσαν διὰ τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, 
[42] τῇ τε γυναικὶ ἔλεγον ὅτι Οὐκέτι διὰ τὴν σὴν λαλιὰν πιστεύομεν: αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἀκηκόαμεν, καὶ οἴδαμεν ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ἀληθῶς ὁ σωτὴρ τοῦ κόσμου.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, Jesus met the woman at the well on a thirsty day.
We have not been having thirsty-day weather lately, but those days are coming.
On a thirsty day it is the middle of the day, it is 90 degrees outside, and you have been walking all morning.
Your water bottle ran out two hours ago and you are thirsty.
People are known to go crazy when they go hungry---they will do things that they would never otherwise do just to get some food down their throats.
But *thirsty* is something else.

I *can* remember being thirsty before---really thirsty.
My thirsty day was the middle of the day, it was 103° outside, and I had been working since the morning.
This was in 1980-somthing in western Ohio, of all places.
I worked at a wheat-breeding farm in Indiana and we were harvesting test plots in Bryan, Ohio.
Harvesting was done by a little combine, but the combined grain did not go into a big bin: the grain went into specially marked bags one by one---one bag for each test plot and we had to hustle to keep the bags moving---maybe 20‑30 pounds per bag.
The combine was faster than we were and we had to hustle to keep the bags moving.
That was the thirstiest I have ever been in my life.
We hardly had time to take a break---we kept moving, moving, moving.
I cannot forget how thirsty I was.
We looked for something to drink but we had no water cooler.
(A cooler of water was all I would have wanted, and I wanted it bad.)
We did have a cooler of ice tea, though, that had warmed up to 103°.
But the ice tea was too strong---it was thick---I do not know why.
Under normal circumstances, I would have said, "No thanks" to the tea but I gulped that sludge down as fast as I could because I was desperately thirsty.

Our spiritual thirst, beloved in the Lord, is for righteousness---we thirst to stand righteous before God, to stand approved before God.
And a woman from Samaria is about to receive her righteousness---she is about to *meet* her righteousness in the person of Jesus.
The day Jesus meets her at the well, they are both thirsty; maybe not desperately thristy.
They meet at the well.

> **Jesus [says] to her, “Give me a drink.”**

> **The Samaritan woman [says] to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)**

The Samaritans, as you know---and we have gone over this in some detail in adult Bible study---are considered by the Jews to be low-life idolaters.
They were once Jews, but now they are mudbloods mixed with Assyrian blood.
Jews want nothing to do with them.
And just for being a Samaritan, the woman might be thirsty for righteousness, for she and her people, the Samaritans, claim to worship the God of Israel on their mountain, but the Jews, who worship God in the temple in Jerusalem, know they have mixed in false-god worship with their true-God worship and that they are not considered to worship the God of Israel at all.
Therefore, the Samaritan woman is thirsty for righteousness to worship the true God of Israel, for she worshiped a false god.

But there is more.

> **Jesus [answers] her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”**

Jesus may have looked like a man who needed water, but he implies to the Samaritan woman that she is in need of *living water*.
Beloved in the Lord, this living water can satisfy her---it can satisfy *your*---thirst for righteousness.

> **Jesus [says] to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”**

Wow.

> **The woman [says] to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”**

In order to drink this water, Jesus has some business to take care of first.

> **Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”**

The woman answers truthfully.

> **“I have no husband.”**

> **“You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”**

For the Samaritan woman falls into the same trap of sin agains marriage that plagues women today: living with a man who is not your husband.
Jesus knows it; the Samaritan woman confesses it: **"I have no husband."**
"He's wonderful and he loves me, but ... I have no husband. He's what I need, but ... I have no husband."
Rationalize it as you want, but the sin of the Samaritan woman---being one flesh man who is not her husband---always ends up with the confession, *"I have no husband."**

In order to receive the living water, Jesus knows that the Samaritan woman must first confess our sin.
Beloved in the Lord, let not *un*confesses sin keep you from Christ's living water.
For here is what that living water is.

> **“If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’” Now this he said about the *Spirit*, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.** [(Jn 7:37‑39ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+7/)

> **Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.”**

Jesus uses God's name for Himself ...

> *For where God and Man both in one are united,*\
> *With God's perfect fulness the heart is delighted.*

The Samaritan womans' heart is delighted with Jesus.
By the woman's testimony, the Samaritans' hearts are delighted with Jesus.
Let your heart delight in the God-man Jesus Christ, who comes to you with living water.
Confess your sins, for He was glorified on the Cross bearing your sins, dying for your sins.
He was raised from the dead and ascended into heaven, from where He pours out on you living water with which to quench your thirst for righteousness.
You are forgiven in His name, righteous in His name, justified in His name.

> **Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.** (Rm 5:1‑4)

AMEN.

## Notes

Jn 4:26. Literally, "*I am* who is speaking to you." Jesus identifies Himself with the Divine Name.

Jn 4:29. Can this be the Christ? Can this be God?

Jn 4:39, 41‑42. The people believed in Jesus because of the woman's personal witness. More came to believe by hearing Jesus.

Jn 4:40. The people in His hometown rejected Him, but the Samaritans wanted Him to stay. This is a very good sign for the Samaritans.
