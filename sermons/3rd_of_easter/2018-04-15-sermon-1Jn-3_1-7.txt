## First Reading [Ac 3:11‑21 ESV]


## Epistle [1Jn 3:1‑7 ESV; sermon text]

[1] See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. [2] Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. [3] And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

[4] Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. [5] You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. [6] No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. [7] Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.

> In your presence there is full- | ness of joy;\*\
> at your right hand are pleasures for- | evermore.\
> I will extol you, O LORD, for you have | drawn me up\*\
