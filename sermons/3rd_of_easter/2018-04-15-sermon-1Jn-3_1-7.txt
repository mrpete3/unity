## First Reading [Ac 3:11‑21 ESV]

[11] While he[^1] clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's. [12] And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk? [13] The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. [14] But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
[15] and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.
[16] And his name—by faith in his name—has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.

[^1]: Ac 3:2: **a man lame from birth**.

[17] "And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. [18] But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled. [19] Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, [20] that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, [21] whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago."

## Epistle [1Jn 3:1‑7 ESV; sermon text]

[1] See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. [2] Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. [3] And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

[4] Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. [5] You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. [6] No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. [7] Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.

[1] ἴδετε ποταπὴν ἀγάπην δέδωκεν ἡμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ἵνα τέκνα θεοῦ κληθῶμεν: καὶ ἐσμέν. διὰ τοῦτο ὁ κόσμος οὐ γινώσκει ἡμᾶς ὅτι οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτόν. 
[2] Ἀγαπητοί, νῦν τέκνα θεοῦ ἐσμεν, καὶ οὔπω ἐφανερώθη τί ἐσόμεθα. οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἐὰν φανερωθῇ ὅμοιοι αὐτῷ ἐσόμεθα, ὅτι ὀψόμεθα αὐτὸν καθώς ἐστιν. 
[3] καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἔχων τὴν ἐλπίδα ταύτην ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἁγνίζει ἑαυτὸν καθὼς ἐκεῖνος ἁγνός ἐστιν. 

[4] Πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν καὶ τὴν ἀνομίαν ποιεῖ, καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία ἐστὶν ἡ ἀνομία. 
[5] καὶ οἴδατε ὅτι ἐκεῖνος ἐφανερώθη ἵνα τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἄρῃ, καὶ ἁμαρτία ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν. 
[6] πᾶς ὁ ἐν αὐτῷ μένων οὐχ ἁμαρτάνει: πᾶς ὁ ἁμαρτάνων οὐχ ἑώρακεν αὐτὸν οὐδὲ ἔγνωκεν αὐτόν. 
[7] Τεκνία, μηδεὶς πλανάτω ὑμᾶς: ὁ ποιῶν τὴν δικαιοσύνην δίκαιός ἐστιν, καθὼς ἐκεῖνος δίκαιός ἐστιν

## Holy Gospel [Lk 24:36‑49 ESV]

[36] As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!”
[37] But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. [38] And he said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? [39] See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”
[40] And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. [41] And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” [42] They gave him a piece of broiled fish, [43] and he took it and ate before them.

[44] Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” [45] Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, [46] and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, [47] and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
[48] You are witnesses of these things.
[49] And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”

## Introit [Ps 30:1-5; antiphon: Ps 16:11b]

> In your presence there is full- | ness of joy;\*\
> at your right hand are pleasures for- | evermore.\
> I will extol you, O LORD, for you have | drawn me up\*\
> and have not let my foes rejoice | over me.\
> O LORD my God, I cried to | you for help,\*\
> and you have | healed me.\
> O LORD, you have brought up my soul | from Sheol;\*\
> you restored me to life from among those who go down | to the pit.\
> Sing praises to the LORD, O | you his saints,\*\
> and give thanks to his | holy name.\
> For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a | lifetime.\*\
> Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the | morning.\

## Collect

O God, through the humiliation of Your Son You raised up the fallen world. Grant to Your faithful people, rescued from the peril of everlasting death, perpetual gladness and eternal joys; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Hymns

* Opening hymn: _TLH_ 201 _Jesus Lives! The Victory's Won_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, He is risen! *[Response]*
*Joy* ... for having heard and believed that Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified under Pontius Pilate has risen indeed from the dead---that is what he have---joy.
Joy ... for having *seen* and believed is what the disciples have in the Holy Gospel.

> **[The disciples] were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. And [Jesus] said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? _See my hands and my feet_, that it is I myself. _Touch me, and see._ For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”** [(Lk 24:37‑39 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+24:37/)

After seeing our resurrected Lord, is was time for the disciples to joy and marvel.
**"See My hands and My feet"** means that Jesus' wounds which He suffered at His Crucifixion were visible to them and unless a heavenly healing has erased those scars, they are *still visible today* as He lives and reigns at the right hand of the Father.
I do not know for sure whether Jesus' wounds are still visible, but I think they are.
It is written in Revelation, chapter 5,

> **Between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, _as though it had been slain_, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.** [(Rv 5:6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+5:6/)

Jesus is seen in heaven visibly *as though He had been slain*, so it may be that *as though He had been slain* means His wounds are still visible.
But there were *many* witnesses of those wounds---those who saw Him receive those wounds and then saw those same wounds on His resurrected body.

The Bible depends on the testimony of these witnesses who have seen and believed, and blessed are you, of course, **who have not seen and yet have believed** [(Jn 20:29 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+20:29/).
In our first reading from Acts, chapter 3, St. Peter says, **"You killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses"** [(Ac 3:15 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+3:15/).
In the Holy Gospel, our Lord tells His disciples, **"You are witnesses of these things"** [(Lk 24:48 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+24:48/).
There are hundreds of witnesses of Christ's Resurrection [(1Co 15:6)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+15:6/).

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
