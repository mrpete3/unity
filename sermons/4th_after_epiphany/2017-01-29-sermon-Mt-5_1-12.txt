## Old Testament [Mi 6:1‑8 ESV]

> [1] Hear what the LORD says:\
> Arise, plead your case before the mountains,\
> and let the hills hear your voice.\
> [2] Hear, you mountains, the indictment of the LORD,\
> and you enduring foundations of the earth,\
> for the LORD has an indictment against his people,\
> and he will contend with Israel.

> [3] “O my people, what have I done to you?\
> How have I wearied you? Answer me!\
> [4] For I brought you up from the land of Egypt\
> and redeemed you from the house of slavery,\
> and I sent before you Moses,\
> Aaron, and Miriam.\
> [5] O my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,\
> and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,\
> and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\
> that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.”

> [6] “With what shall I come before the LORD,\
> and bow myself before God on high?\
> Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,\
> with calves a year old?\
> [7] Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,\
> with ten thousands of rivers of oil?\
> Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\
> the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”\
> [8] He has told you, O man, what is good;\
> and what does the LORD require of you\
> but to do justice, and to love kindness,\
> and to walk humbly with your God?

## Epistle [1Co 1:18‑31 ESV]

[18] For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. [19] For it is written,

> “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\
> and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”
  
 [20] Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? [21] For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. [22] For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, [23] but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, [24] but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. [25] For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

[26] For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. [27] But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; [28] God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, [29] so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. [30] And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, [31] so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”

## Holy Gospel [Mt 5:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Seeing the crowds, [Jesus] went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.

[2] And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:

[3] “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[4] “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

[5] “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

[6] “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

[7] “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.

[8] “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

[9] “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

[10] “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[11] “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.”

[1] Ἰδὼν δὲ τοὺς ὄχλους ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος: καὶ καθίσαντος αὐτοῦ προσῆλθαν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ: 

[2] καὶ ἀνοίξας τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ ἐδίδασκεν αὐτοὺς λέγων, 

[3] Μακάριοι οἱ πτωχοὶ τῷ πνεύματι, ὅτι αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν. 

[4] μακάριοι οἱ πενθοῦντες, ὅτι αὐτοὶ παρακληθήσονται. 

[5] μακάριοι οἱ πραεῖς, ὅτι αὐτοὶ κληρονομήσουσιν τὴν γῆν. 

[6] μακάριοι οἱ πεινῶντες καὶ διψῶντες τὴν δικαιοσύνην, ὅτι αὐτοὶ χορτασθήσονται. 

[7] μακάριοι οἱ ἐλεήμονες, ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἐλεηθήσονται. 

[8] μακάριοι οἱ καθαροὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ, ὅτι αὐτοὶ τὸν θεὸν ὄψονται. 

[9] μακάριοι οἱ εἰρηνοποιοί, ὅτι αὐτοὶ υἱοὶ θεοῦ κληθήσονται. 

[10] μακάριοι οἱ δεδιωγμένοι ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης, ὅτι αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν. 

[11] μακάριοί ἐστε ὅταν ὀνειδίσωσιν ὑμᾶς καὶ διώξωσιν καὶ εἴπωσιν πᾶν πονηρὸν καθ' ὑμῶν [ψευδόμενοι] ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ: 
[12] χαίρετε καὶ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε, ὅτι ὁ μισθὸς ὑμῶν πολὺς ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς: οὕτως γὰρ ἐδίωξαν τοὺς προφήτας τοὺς πρὸ ὑμῶν.

## Introit [Ps 1:1-5; antiphon: Ps 1:6]

> For the LORD knows the way of the | righteous,\*\
> but the way of the wicked will | perish.\
> Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the | wicked,\*\
> nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of | scoffers;\
> but his delight is in the law | of the LORD,\*\
> and on his law he meditates | day and night.\
> He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not | wither.\*\
> In all that he does, he | prospers.\
> The wicked | are not so,\*\
> but are like chaff that the wind | drives away.\
> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the | judgment,\*\
> nor sinners in the congregation of the | righteous.\

## Collect

Almighty God, You know we live in the midst of so many dangers that in our frailty we cannot stand upright. Grant strength and protection to support us in all dangers and carry us through all temptations; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Notes

Mi 6:5. _Shittim to Gilgal_. Shittim is mentioned for the first time in the Bible in Nm 25:1; this is where the Israelites worshiped Baal of Peor.
Jsh 14:19‑22 revels that Gilgal is the spot where the Israelites crossed the Jordan River on dry ground to enter the Promised Land.
