## Old Testament [Dt 18:15‑20 ESV]

[15] "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers---it is to him you shall listen---[16] just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.’
[17] And the LORD said to me, ‘They are right in what they have spoken.
[18] I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.
[19] And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him.
[20] But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.’"

## Epistle [1Co 8:1‑13 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that “all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” puffs up, but love builds up. [2] If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. [3] But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.

[4] Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “an idol has no real existence,” and that “there is no God but one.” [5] For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”—[6] yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.

[7] However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. [8] Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. [9] But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. [10] For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols? [11] And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. [12] Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. [13] Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.

[1] Περὶ δὲ τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων, οἴδαμεν ὅτι πάντες γνῶσιν ἔχομεν. ἡ γνῶσις φυσιοῖ, ἡ δὲ ἀγάπη οἰκοδομεῖ. 
[2] εἴ τις δοκεῖ ἐγνωκέναι τι, οὔπω ἔγνω καθὼς δεῖ γνῶναι: 
[3] εἰ δέ τις ἀγαπᾷ τὸν θεόν, οὗτος ἔγνωσται ὑπ' αὐτοῦ. 

[4] Περὶ τῆς βρώσεως οὖν τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων οἴδαμεν ὅτι οὐδὲν εἴδωλον ἐν κόσμῳ, καὶ ὅτι οὐδεὶς θεὸς εἰ μὴ εἷς. 
[5] καὶ γὰρ εἴπερ εἰσὶν λεγόμενοι θεοὶ εἴτε ἐν οὐρανῷ εἴτε ἐπὶ γῆς, ὥσπερ εἰσὶν θεοὶ πολλοὶ καὶ κύριοι πολλοί, 
[6] ἀλλ' ἡμῖν εἷς θεὸς ὁ πατήρ, ἐξ οὗ τὰ πάντα καὶ ἡμεῖς εἰς αὐτόν, καὶ εἷς κύριος Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, δι' οὗ τὰ πάντα καὶ ἡμεῖς δι' αὐτοῦ. 

[7] Ἀλλ' οὐκ ἐν πᾶσιν ἡ γνῶσις: τινὲς δὲ τῇ συνηθείᾳ ἕως ἄρτι τοῦ εἰδώλου ὡς εἰδωλόθυτον ἐσθίουσιν, καὶ ἡ συνείδησις αὐτῶν ἀσθενὴς οὖσα μολύνεται. 
[8] βρῶμα δὲ ἡμᾶς οὐ παραστήσει τῷ θεῷ: οὔτε ἐὰν μὴ φάγωμεν ὑστερούμεθα, οὔτε ἐὰν φάγωμεν περισσεύομεν. 
[9] βλέπετε δὲ μή πως ἡ ἐξουσία ὑμῶν αὕτη πρόσκομμα γένηται τοῖς ἀσθενέσιν. 
[10] ἐὰν γάρ τις ἴδῃ σὲ τὸν ἔχοντα γνῶσιν ἐν εἰδωλείῳ κατακείμενον, οὐχὶ ἡ συνείδησις αὐτοῦ ἀσθενοῦς ὄντος οἰκοδομηθήσεται εἰς τὸ τὰ εἰδωλόθυτα ἐσθίειν; 
[11] ἀπόλλυται γὰρ ὁ ἀσθενῶν ἐν τῇ σῇ γνώσει, ὁ ἀδελφὸς δι' ὃν Χριστὸς ἀπέθανεν. 
[12] οὕτως δὲ ἁμαρτάνοντες εἰς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τύπτοντες αὐτῶν τὴν συνείδησιν ἀσθενοῦσαν εἰς Χριστὸν ἁμαρτάνετε. 
[13] διόπερ εἰ βρῶμα σκανδαλίζει τὸν ἀδελφόν μου, οὐ μὴ φάγω κρέα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, ἵνα μὴ τὸν ἀδελφόν μου σκανδαλίσω.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 1:21‑28 ESV]

[21] And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. 
[22] And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
[23] And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, 
[24] “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are---the Holy One of God.” 
[25] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”
[26] And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.

[27] And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”
[28] And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.

## Introit [Ps 32:1-2, 5-7; antiphon: Ps 32:10]

> Many are the sorrows of the | wicked,\*\
> but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts | in the LORD.\
> Blessed is the one whose transgression is for- | given,\*\
> whose sin is | covered.\
> Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no in- | iquity,\*\
> and in whose spirit there is | no deceit.\
> I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my in- | iquity;\*\
> I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and you forgave the iniquity | of my sin.\
> Therefore let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you | may be found;\*\
> surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not | reach him.\
> You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from | trouble;\*\
> you surround me with shouts of de- | liverance.\

## Collect

Almighty God, You know we live in the midst of so many dangers that in our frailty we cannot stand upright. Grant strength and protection to support us in all dangers and carry us through all temptations; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Our Old Testament reading today could have just as well be an Old Testament reading for Advent, for it is one of the Old Testament prophecies of the Christ:

> **I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.** [(Dt 18:18 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+18/)

The LORD promised Moses that a prophet like Moses would come after him, but one that the Israelites need not fear like they were afraid at Mount Horeb when the LORD handed the Ten Commandments to Moses.
You may remember that the day the Ten Commandments were given to Moses was a frightening day---the people were to stay away from the mountain on the threat of death.
You may be aware that I have repeated the Ten Commandments recently from this pulpit, but instead of repeating them all today, do you remember from confirmation which is the one Commandment that if you keep it, you keep all the Commandments? ...
Which Commandment is that? ...
It is the First Commandment, of course:

> **You shall have no other gods.** Or, as you may have learned it: **Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.**
*What does this mean?* We should fear, love, and trust in God above all things.

This is the Commandment that if you keep it, you keep all the Commandments.
If you do not fear, love, and trust in God above all things, then you *will* sin automatically.
But what is it that there is to trust in God?
When you trust someone, how is it that you know that you trust him?
You know that you trust if you *listen* to him or her.
You trust the one you listen to. Everyone understands that!
Now concerning the Prophet that the LORD will send, the Prophet like Moses: **"I will put My Words in His mouth."**
In other words, "He is the one you should *listen to*. You will hear My words from His mouth."
What God desires in the First Commandment is simply that we listen to Him; in other words, trust Him.

But this can be tricky when your flesh gets involved.
Suppose you listen to the Words from God's mouth.
Now you know something that someone else, who has not listened, does not.
You have knowledge that someone else does not.
For example, if you have a degree in microbiology from Case, you know something that someone else, who has not studied microbiology, does not.
In the Epistle reading today, St. Paul warns that **"knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."**
Let us look at this with some care: **"Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."**
The Greek word for *knowledge* in our Epistle reading is *gnosis*---gnosis puffs up, but love builds up---and if you have studied any church history at all, that word, *gnosis*, rings a bell---*gnosis*---*Gnosticism*.
Though Paul may not be addressing Gnosticism directly in this verse, the idea of *knowledge puffing up* is something found in Gnosticism and it is a fatal weakness in our sinful flesh.

If I know something you do not, my flesh wants to *[Puff up your chest.]* *puff up* and say, "I know something you do not. *You* should listen to *me*"
Frankly, it makes sense.
Should not the people who do *not* know something listen to someone who *does*?
*But*, who then is the greatest?
The one who knows the most is the greatest.
Now when the flesh kicks in and the evil spirits start playing, you will find a contest where people, ignorant of Christ, kick and scream to show that they are smarter than than others, that their knowledge is the greatest and that *they* should do the talking while others listen.
If they are successful in commanding the attention of others and gathering violent men around them, you get an Adolf Hitler, and then you get a Joseph Stalin, and even Europe is not big enough to hold the two of them; the *whole world* is dragged into their contest of who is the greatest.

How does knowledge puff up?
When my flesh deceives me into thinking I am someone greater by virtue of my knowledge. Watch out for knowledge puffing up: it can get you in a lot of trouble.
What kind of trouble?
*Does your knowledge have the power to cast out demons?*
Go out there with your knowledge and see how you do against the devil.
Remember that the devil's magicians were able to match Moses' miracles in Egypt: they also turned water into blood [(Ex 7:22)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+7/) and made frogs swarm over Egypt [(Ex 8:7)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+8/).
And who can forget the sons of Sceva, the **itinerant Jewish exorcists [who] undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims"** [(Ac 19:13 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+19/)?
Do you remember what happened when they used the name of Jesus to cast out a demon?

> **The evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?” And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.** [(Ac 19:15‑16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+19/)

The sons of Sceva even had the knowledge of the name of Jesus and were overpowered by demons.
This knowledge is powerless against the devil; this kind of knowledge is quickly overpowered by demons---Satan twists your arm around your back and takes control.

Then we have Jesus Himself in the Holy Gospel:

> **And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are---the Holy One of God.” But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.** [(Mk 1:23‑26 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+1/)

*All Jesus has to know is who He is.* ...
And I hope, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, you see the difference between knowledge and love---it is not an idea---it is who Jesus is.
Jesus knows who He is, but do you?
If you ever need a reminder, come to church every Sunday and believe these words well:

> **And [I believe] in one Lord Jesus Christ,**\
> **the only-begotten Son of God,**\
> **begotten of His Father before all worlds,**\
> **God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God,**\
> **begotten, not made,**\
> **being of one substance with the Father,**\
> **by whom all things were made;**
> **who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven**\
> **and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary**\
> **and was made man;**\
> **and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.**\
> **He suffered and was buried.**\
> **And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures**\
> **and ascended into heaven**\
> **and sits at the right hand of the Father.**\
> **And He will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead,**\
> **whose kingdom will have no end.**

Yes, God's love is reveled in His only-begotten Son Jesus, who was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary to be crucified under Pontius Pilate for our sins.
We know that God is love because He sacrificed what was dearest to Him---the Father sacrificed His beloved Son---the Son sacrificed His own life---just to make sure that *your* sins were atoned for.
Any punishment incurred by your sins Jesus bore on the Cross in your place and now all is paid by His blood, you are saved by His name, *[Point to baptismal font.]* He washes you clean of your sins in your Baptism, and *[Point to altar.]* He feeds you with His body and blood at the altar, given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins.
That is *Christian* knowledge,
and you cannot separate Christian knowledge from the love of God revealed in Christ.
*Christian knowledge loves.*
Christian knowledge loves and would rather act like he knows nothing just to have the opportunity to love, and even suffer deprivation, if necessary, if it is God's good and gracious will.
AMEN.
