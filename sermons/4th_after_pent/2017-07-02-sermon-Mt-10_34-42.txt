## Old Testament [Jer 28:5‑9 ESV]

[5] Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD, [6] and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD make the words that you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the LORD, and all the exiles. [7] Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people. [8] The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms. [9] As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent the prophet.”

## Epistle [Rm 7:1‑13 ESV]

[1] Or do you not know, brothers—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives? [2] For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. [3] Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.

[4] Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. [5] For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. [6] But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.

[7] What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.” [8] But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. [9] I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. [10] The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. [11] For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. [12] So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.

[13] Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 10:34‑42 ESV; sermon text]

[34] “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. [35] For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. [36] And a person's enemies will be those of his own household. [37] Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. [38] And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. [39] Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

[40] “Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. [41] The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. [42] And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.”

[34] Μὴ νομίσητε ὅτι ἦλθον βαλεῖν εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν: οὐκ ἦλθον βαλεῖν εἰρήνην ἀλλὰ μάχαιραν. 
[35] ἦλθον γὰρ διχάσαι ἄνθρωπον κατὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ θυγατέρα κατὰ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ νύμφην κατὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς αὐτῆς, 
[36] καὶ ἐχθροὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου οἱ οἰκιακοὶ αὐτοῦ. 
[37] Ὁ φιλῶν πατέρα ἢ μητέρα ὑπὲρ ἐμὲ οὐκ ἔστιν μου ἄξιος: καὶ ὁ φιλῶν υἱὸν ἢ θυγατέρα ὑπὲρ ἐμὲ οὐκ ἔστιν μου ἄξιος: 
[38] καὶ ὃς οὐ λαμβάνει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀκολουθεῖ ὀπίσω μου, οὐκ ἔστιν μου ἄξιος. 
[39] ὁ εὑρὼν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπολέσει αὐτήν, καὶ ὁ ἀπολέσας τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ εὑρήσει αὐτήν. 

[40] Ὁ δεχόμενος ὑμᾶς ἐμὲ δέχεται, καὶ ὁ ἐμὲ δεχόμενος δέχεται τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με. 
[41] ὁ δεχόμενος προφήτην εἰς ὄνομα προφήτου μισθὸν προφήτου λήμψεται, καὶ ὁ δεχόμενος δίκαιον εἰς ὄνομα δικαίου μισθὸν δικαίου λήμψεται. 
[42] καὶ ὃς ἂν ποτίσῃ ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων ποτήριον ψυχροῦ μόνον εἰς ὄνομα μαθητοῦ, ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, our Holy Gospel today is sobering, to say the least.
Our Lord Jesus tells us plainly,

> **"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."**

Now wait a minute!
Have we not heard over and over again from Christ's own lips that He brings peace?

> **"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."** [(Jn 14:27 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+14/)

And again,

> **"I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world."** [(Jn 16:33 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+16/)

On Easter Sunday, our risen Lord *cannot stop saying* **"Peace be with you."**

> **On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, _“Peace be with you.”_ When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, “_Peace be with you._ As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.” And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.”** [(Jn 20:19‑23 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+20/)

So which way is it? **"Peace be with you"** or **"I have not come to bring peace, but a sword"**?

> **"For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a person's enemies will be those of his own household."**

The key is found when Jesus says He brings peace.
**"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. _Not as the world gives_ do I give to you."**
And again He says, **"I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. _In the world you will have tribulation._ But take heart; I have overcome the world."**
Jesus' peace is real, but He is always in conflict with the devil, and by extension, with the world.
If your family members---God forbid---are set in the kingdom of the world and you are set in the kingdom of heaven, expect tribulation---expect trouble.
You can bet on it.

A lot of trouble can be avoided simply by one person respecting the other.
There is something to be said about respecting each other.
"Hey, if I see things one way and you see things another way, I still respect you."
But, beloved in the Lord, God has revealed to us in the Bible that there is nevertheless a *mortal battle going on* in which we, the followers of Christ, are fighting.

> **We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.** [(Eph 6:12‑13 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+6/)

It is the devil's army against the Lord's army, and you, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, are in the Lord's army.
This is a fight that you cannot get out of; this is a fight you cannot stand to lose.
Remember how the devil came at Jesus.

> **The devil took [Jesus] to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.’” Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.** [(Mt 4:8‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+4/)

Satan has set up a temporary kingdom in this world of which he is the boss.
Do not be fooled into thinking this is not true---that the world is a place to which you want to conform---for God has revealed to us in the Bible that it is otherwise.
Beware! Satan comes at you through the world.
If you want to be someone in the world, Satan will give you an offer and all that it will cost you is your life.
However, our Lord Jesus came to defeat the devil. **The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil** [(1Jn 3:8b ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+3/).
And where the Son of God is destroying the works of the devil in you---where you are taking orders from Christ and defying the orders of the devil---you better believe there will be a conflict.

As Saint Peter says, **"In your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil"** [(1Pt 3:15‑17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+3/).
Fight with gentleness and respect.
It is not a matter of *if* you will be slandered, it is a matter of *when* you will be slandered---and our Holy Gospel today says that your slanderers may even be from your own family.
The bottom line is that **it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil**.
Yes, beloved in the Lord, *that* is your reality in this world: expect to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will.

Fortunately, however, you know exactly how it works.
For Joseph, the son of Jacob, did well but suffered evil at the hands *of his own brothers*.
They threw him in a well and the sold him to Ishmaelite traders who sold him into slavery in Egypt.
God allowed this terrible thing to happen to him so that there might be some good.
Joseph rose from being a slave in Egypt to being second in authority---second only to Pharaoh.
Our Lord gave Joseph such wisdom that he made Pharaoh a great man and saved Egypt in a seven-year famine (Gn 41:30).
He also saved his family from famine, including his father and including the brothers who mean him harm.

Yes, beloved in the Lord, you know exactly how it works---how it works when you suffer for doing good in Christ's name.
For Christ Himself suffered the greatest injustice imaginable: the Righteous One crucified for the unrighteous.
But what He brought about was to propitiate His Father for our sins.
For all that Christ suffered, your heavenly Father forgives you and gives you His true peace.
Who knows what good He will work from your suffering?
AMEN.
