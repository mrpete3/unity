## Old Testament [Is 7:10‑17 ESV]

[10] Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, [11] “Ask a sign of the Lord your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” [12] But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.” [13] And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? [14] Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. [15] He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. [16] For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. [17] The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria.”

## Epistle [Rm 1:1‑7 ESV]

[1:1] Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, [2] which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, [3] concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh [4] and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, [5] through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, [6] including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,
[7] To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 1:18‑25 ESV; sermon text]

[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:

> [23] “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,\
> and they shall call his name Immanuel”
	
(which means, God with us). [24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, now is the time of the church year when we remember
that the Old Testament has a lot to say about Christ.
The Old Testament not only mentions Christ, the Old Testament is *about* Christ and we cannot wait until He gets here!

Take Jacob's ladder for example.
Jacob had deceived his father to receive his father's blessing.
You may remember that his brother Esau was left out---he received no blessing.
Esau had in mind to kill his brother Jacob, so Jacob fled to his uncle.
But on his way there, he rested to sleep.
Jacob had a rock for a pillow and laid down to sleep.


> **And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!**
> **And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, &ldquo;I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&rdquo;** [(Gn&nbsp;28:12&#x2011;14 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2028%3A12-14/)

Where his Christ in this dream?
In this promise: **&ldquo;In you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&rdquo;**
This was the promise given to Abraham; this was the promise given to Isaac; and now it is the promise that continues through Jacob.
Jacob had just lied to his father to receive his father's blessing---he had reson to not only fear his brother's revenge but to fear God's punishment for stealing.
Jacob is a confused sinner and God comes to him with comfort!
Jacob sees the angels of God ascending and descending on a ladder between earth and heaven, and there is the LORD, standing above the ladder promising to be with him and to bless him and to declare that through his offspring the Messiah would be born and all the families of the earth will be blessed.
What comfort for a sinner to know that Christ is coming!
And the sign for Jacob is a lot of angelic traffic between earth and heaven.

As Christ is about to be born, there is a pickup of angelic traffic.
The ladder seems to come down and earth becomes Grand Central Station for angels.
First, the angel Gabriel visits Zechariah and tells him that he and his wife will be parents of John the Baptist, who **will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb**.
John will go before the Lord God **in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared** [(Lk&nbsp;1:15&#x2011;17)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%201%3A15-17/)

Second, Gabriel makes another visit, but this time to Mary.
You know the story, but this is the time to tell it again.

> **The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, &ldquo;Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!&rdquo;** [(Lk&nbsp;1:26&#x2011;28)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%201%3A26-28/)

Although Mary was afraid at first, she finally believed what Gabriel told her and by faith the Holy Spirit came upon her and the power of the Most High overshadowed her so that the prophecy of Isaiah would be fulfilled:
**&ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel&rdquo;** [(Is&nbsp;7:14 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%207%3A14/).
And *miraculously* her Son Jesus was conceived just as the prophet had prophesied!
The conception of the Christ Child was miraculous because it happened without sin.
You and I were conceived *with* sin---a sinful, earthly father was involved.
But the Christ Child was conceived in His mother Mary without sin---by faith in God's plain Word and by the Holy Spirit this was a holy job that led to a holy night.

> *Silent night, holy night!*\
> *All is calm, all is bright!*\
> *Round yon virgin mother and Child*\
> *Holy infant so tender and mild*

The Child in the manger is not sinful infant.
He is **Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace** [(Is&nbsp;9:6)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%209%3A6/). O come, let us adore Him Christ the Lord!

But all the while when Mary was great with Child, but Joseph was worried for he could not help but think,
&ldquo;What sin has my Mary done that she is pregnant? I will divorce her quietly.&rdquo;
It appeared to Joseph that a sin had been committed against marriage and he could not imagine that Mary's Child had *nothing to do with sin* but that this Child is the one who comes to *fight sin to the death* and *save us from sin*.
Joseph had no clue and needed, again, a message from an angel to get it straight:

> **And [Mary's] husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an _angel of the Lord_ appeared to him in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&rdquo; All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:**

> **&ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,**\
> **and they shall call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (which means, God with us).**

Not only can Joseph rejoice over Mary and her Child---not only can Joseph be amazed---but the angels themselves!
A human child born of a virgin! A human child who is called the Son of God!
A human child whose name is Jesus---which means &ldquo;Savior&rdquo;!
A human child whose name is also Immanuel---which means &ldquo;God with us&rdquo;!
Angels are heavenly; man is earthly.
Angels are higher than man, but God has chosen *man*---God has chosen to become a man---one of us!
The Christ Child is both God and man.
He sees with eyes like we do, He feels happy and sad like we do, cold and heat.
He touches with his fingertips and nurses at his mother's breast like we do.
He is the same as us, yet ... without sin.
At this, the busy angels are amazed.
And if God has become man, then man must be his friend.

But that God has become our friend is not just about the birth of the Christ Child.
Baby Jesus has not only to be born, but also suffer and die bearing the burden of our sins.
For this He is born, Christ the Lord, to carry away our sins as far as the east if from the west (Ps&nbsp;103:12).
His fight against sin is yet to come, and we will see it on Good Friday.
But for now is our dear Christ Child.
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord! AMEN.

## Notes

Is 7:14‑17. Luther says there are two signs in these verses: one sign Ahaz will not see but the other one he will.
