## Old Testament [2Sm 7:1‑11, 16 ESV]

[1] Now when the king lived in his house and the LORD had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies, [2] the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.” [3] And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”

[4] But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, [5] “Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: Would you build me a house to dwell in? [6] I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling. [7] In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’ [8] Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel. [9] And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. [10] And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, [11] from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house.
...
[16] And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”

## Epistle [Rm 16:25‑27 ESV; sermon text]

[25] Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages [26] but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith—[27] to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen.

[25] δὲ δυναμένῳ ὑμᾶς στηρίξαι κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου καὶ τὸ κήρυγμα Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν μυστηρίου χρόνοις αἰωνίοις σεσιγημένου 
[26] φανερωθέντος δὲ νῦν διά τε γραφῶν προφητικῶν κατ' ἐπιταγὴν τοῦ αἰωνίου θεοῦ εἰς ὑπακοὴν πίστεως εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη γνωρισθέντος, 
[27] μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ᾧ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας: ἀμήν.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 1:26‑38 ESV]

[26] In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, [27] to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. [28] And he came to her and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” [29] But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. [30] And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. [31] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. [32] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, [33] and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”

[34] And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”

[35] And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. [36] And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. [37] For nothing will be impossible with God.” [38] And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.

## Introit [Ps 19:1, 4c, 5-6; antiphon: Is 45:8a, b]

> Shower, O heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain down | righteousness;\*\
> let the earth open, that salvation and righteousness may | bear fruit.\
> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his | handiwork.\*\
> In them he has set a tent | for the sun,\
> which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his | chamber,\*\
> and, like a strong man, runs its | course with joy.\
> Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the | end of them,\*\
> and there is nothing hidden | from its heat.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Oh, it is so nearly Christmas!
The Fourth Sunday of Advent is upon us---the Sunday of *love*---hope, peace, joy, and *love*---and now Christmas Eve is upon us.
Too much excitement for one day---or can I even say that?

God is breaking into our lives! Alleluia!
We are here because God is breaking into our lives.
This morning, we focus on a specific aspect of God breaking into our lives: He chose to to it through history.
It is one thing to say that God spoke to me in private and another to say that God acts in history.
Behold our Old Testament reading from 2 Samuel, chapter 7, before David committed sin over Bathsheba.
God spoke to David in private through the prophet Nathan.
For the LORD had blessed David to put terrible Goliath to death but to refrain from putting Saul to death even though Saul wanted to kill David.
Twice David could have put Saul to death while Saul was asleep, but David would not do it because he was afraid to kill the king whom God had anointed king over Israel, as wicked as the king may be.
David had so much respect for God's anointed king that guess what? ...
David trusted the LORD through thick and thin, and David had become a great king of Israel, anointed by the LORD and loved by his subjects.
David said,

> **“See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.” And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”** [(2Sm 7:2‑3 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7/)

But, as you heard, the LORD corrected Nathan to tell David *not* to build a house for the LORD---that would be left for David's son, Solomon, to do.
Nevertheless, David had so much respect for God and for God's anointed king that God made him a promise---a *big* promise:

> **"I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. ... And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. ...  And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever."** [(2Sm 7: 9, 11, 16)](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7/)

That is an awesome promise to make: your name will never disappear from the face of the earth, and the one who sits on the throne at last will be your great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson.
*A thousand years later*, when the angel Gabriel tells Mary, **"The Lord God will give to [your Son] the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end"** [(Lk 1:32‑33 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1/), Gabriel is announcing to Mary that what God promised David is fulfilled in her son Jesus!
God had arranged all of *history* for a thousand years for this moment.
*Not once* during that time did God ever let the promise slip---He was bringing it all about, even through the splitting of the kingdom of Israel into two, then the destruction of the northern kingdom by the Assyrians, then the destruction of the southern kingdom and the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians, and then the return of the Jews to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.
Then there was a nasty man name Antiochus Epiphanes ruling over Jerusalem who as not a Jewish king at all.
What had happened to the line of David and the Jewish kings? Had God forgotten His promise to David? Hardly.
Just when it seems that things are bad and God's promise has been snuffed out, think again.
God *loves* to bring the victory *just when* others have given up.
Help us, heavenly Father, to be the ones who cling to Your promises in the face of naysayers.

AMEN.

## Notes

Rm 16:26. The *obedience of faith* is seen repeatedly with Paul.
*Obedience* is ὑπακοὴν: *to hear under*.

The theme for the Fourth Sunday of Advent is *Love*.
