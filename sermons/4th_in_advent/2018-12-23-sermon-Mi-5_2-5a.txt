## Old Testament [Mi 5:2‑5a ESV; sermon text]

> [2]  But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,\
> who are too little to be among the clans of Judah,\
> from you shall come forth for me\
> one who is to be ruler in Israel,\
> whose coming forth is from of old,\
> from ancient days.\
> [3] Therefore he shall give them up until the time\
> when she who is in labor has given birth;\
> then the rest of his brothers shall return\
> to the people of Israel.\
> [4] And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD,\
> in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God.\
> And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great\
> to the ends of the earth.\
> [5] And he shall be their peace.

[2] Καὶ σύ, Βηθλεεμ οἶκος τοῦ Εφραθα, ὀλιγοστὸς εἶ τοῦ εἶναι ἐν χιλιάσιν Ιουδα· ἐκ σοῦ μοι ἐξελεύσεται τοῦ εἶναι εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ, καὶ αἱ ἔξοδοι αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς ἐξ ἡμερῶν αἰῶνος. 
[3] διὰ τοῦτο δώσει αὐτοὺς ἕως καιροῦ τικτούσης τέξεται, καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ. 
[4] καὶ στήσεται καὶ ὄψεται καὶ ποιμανεῖ τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἰσχύι κυρίου, καὶ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ τοῦ ὀνόματος κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτῶν ὑπάρξουσιν· διότι νῦν μεγαλυνθήσεται ἕως ἄκρων τῆς γῆς. 
[5] καὶ ἔσται αὕτη εἰρήνη.

## Epistle [Heb 10:5‑10 ESV]

[5] Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,

> “Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,\
> but a body have you prepared for me;\
> [6] in burnt offerings and sin offerings\
> you have taken no pleasure.\
> [7] Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,\
> as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”

[8] When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), [9] then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. [10] And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 1:39‑56 ESV]

[39] In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, [40] and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. [41] And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, [42] and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! [43] And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? [44] For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. [45] And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”

[46] And Mary said,

> “My soul magnifies the Lord,\
> [47] 	and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,\
> [48] for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.\
> For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;\
> [49] for he who is mighty has done great things for me,\
> and holy is his name.\
> [50] And his mercy is for those who fear him\
> from generation to generation.\
> [51] He has shown strength with his arm;\
> he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;\
> [52] he has brought down the mighty from their thrones\
> and exalted those of humble estate;\
> [53] he has filled the hungry with good things,\
> and the rich he has sent away empty.\
> [54] He has helped his servant Israel,\
> in remembrance of his mercy,\
> [55] as he spoke to our fathers,\
> to Abraham and to his offspring forever.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
You may know well the prophecies of Isaiah concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:

> **Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz: “Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.” And he said, "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel,"** ([Is 7:10‑14](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+7:10/) ESV) which means *God with us*.

And again, from the mouth of Isaiah:

> **There will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he
 brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the 
latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan,
 Galilee of the nations. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great
 light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. ... For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be up
on his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, _Mighty God_, _Everlasting Father_, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of
 peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold with justice and with righteousness from this time forth
 and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.** ([Is 9:1‑2, 6‑7](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+9/) ESV)

Of course, these verses alone could be preached for years, and you will hear more about *God with us* tomorrow, on Christmas Eve.
Isaiah also proclaims the Son who is born for us to be **Mighty God, Everlasting Father**.
So if there is anyone who casts doubt on Christ being God Himself, a quick check on Isaiah chapters 7 and 9 will give you a clear proclamation of who the Christ child is.
Jesus is God and God is Jesus.

Isaiah seems to dominate Old Testament prophecies about Christ, but at the very same time that Isaiah was prophesying, there was another---yes, at the very same time there was yet another prophet prophesying about the Christ, and he is the prophet Micah.
Now, you may not hear so much from Micah as you do from Isaiah, but that is because Isaiah has 66 chapters and Micah has seven.
Let us turn now to what the prophet Micah reveals to us.
In chapter 4, we hear this from the mouth of Micah:

> **It shall come to pass in the latter days**\
> **that the mountain of the house of the LORD**\
> **shall be established as the highest of the mountains,**\
> **and it shall be lifted up above the hills;**\
> **and peoples shall flow to it.** ([Mi 4:1](https://www.esv.org/Micah+4/) ESV)

But from the mouth of Isaiah, where hear this in chapter 2:

> **It shall come to pass in the latter days**\
> **that the mountain of the house of the LORD**\
> **shall be established as the highest of the mountains,**\
> **and shall be lifted up above the hills;**\
> **and all the nations shall flow to it.** ([Is 2:2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+2:2/) ESV)

Yes, for a few verses in Isaiah, chapter 2 and Micah, chapter 4, we hear the same message nearly word-for word---from both prophets we hear that the Gentiles will abandon their idols and come to worship the one true God of Israel at the mountain of the house of the LORD.

Though the Gentiles will come to worship the one true God of Israel, Micah's big complaint is about the sin of the people of Israel and that there is no faithful shepherd to care for them.
There is no faithful shepherd to expose their sin and say, "God is angry with your idolatry and will punish you severely. Stop now!"
There is no faithful shepherd to warn them that when God punishes their idolatry, a foreign army will come and beseige Jerusalem and the starvation will be so great that parents will eat their own children.
Sin is serious! Stop now!
But you, as a sheep of the flock of Israel, would no know this from your kings and your priests---the shepherds that God has called to care for you.
The priests and the kings are idolaters themselves and have shirked their duty.

Let us pause here and pray:

> Gracious Father, you have a holy hatred of sin. Let us not be the ones to take our own sin lightly.
Let the world sin and not heed your warnings, but for us, we pray, for us who are redeemed by Christ, refine us and purify us by your Holy Spirit.
Expose our sins, we pray, and may they burn hot in our hearts that we cry out in repentance.
Then comfort us with the balm of Holy Absolution proclaimed in Jesus' name and bless us with faith to believe what is forgiven here on earth in Jesus' name is also forgiven in heaven.
During this season of Advent bless us with Your Spirit that we heed the preaching of John the Baptist and bear fruit in keeping with repentance,[^1] through our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.

[^1]: [Lk 3:8](https://www.esv.org/Luke+3:8/)

Let us then examine ourselves and consider whether we as Americans are prone to *individualism*.
"I don't need anyone to tell me what to do: I am my own person."
That thinking draws many away from recognizing that because of my sin, *my own person*, if I would like to assert that *I am my own person*---because of my sin, *my own person* is characterized by *a sheep*.
I have been debilitated by my own sin and you might as well call me a *sheep*.
A sheep is a dumb, defenseless animal in need of a shepherd if it is to survive.
*[Solicit]* Have any of you ever kept sheep?
Do you have stories to share about sheep?
(I sheared a sheep once, but that is it.)
Nevertheless, a sheep is a dependent animal---it needs constant care to stay healthy---shear its wool, trim its hooves, make sure is has enough food and water---and if you leave it alone with the wolf around, *the wolf wins every time*.
Observe the complete victory of Satan over each and every person who would say,
"I don't need anyone to tell me what to do: I am my own person."

God called priests, Levites, and prophets to shepherd His called people in the Old Testment days, and today you have your pastor to feed you with God's Word anD Sacraments, and to chase off the devil in Christ's name.
God has always shepherded His people by called servants who are to do no other than shepherd by His revealed Word.
If a shepherd does not do his job, his sheep will scatter and again be vulnerable to Satan's attacks.

What Micah promises is a faithful Shepherd:

> **But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,**\
> **who are too little to be among the clans of Judah,**\
> **from you shall come forth for me**\
> **one who is to be ruler in Israel,**\
> **whose coming forth is from of old,**\
> **from ancient days. ...**\
> **And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD,**\
> **in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God.**\
> **And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great**\
> **to the ends of the earth.**

By this promise, beloved in the Lord, you have the security of having a faithful Good Shepherd, and He is Jesus!
What we are promised with the coming of our Lord Jesus is that He will finally put an end to the problem of unfaithful shepherds.
*He Himself* will shepherd His Church in the strength of the LORD.
He is not the latest shepherd to show up on the scene, His **coming forth is from of old**---He is, you may say, an ancient Shepherd who has been preparing to care for His flock for a very long time---He has been preparing *to die* for his flock for a very long time.
So, abandon your notion that you are able to handle yourself and welcome the Ancient Shepherd Jesus who comes to care for you and protect you from the devil.

Micah's final words are these, and they are words of comfort for sinners:

> **Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity**\
> **and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance?**\
> **He does not retain his anger forever,**\
> **because he delights in steadfast love.**\
> **He will again have compassion on us;**\
> **he will tread our iniquities underfoot.**\
> **You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.**\
> **You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham,**\
> **as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.** ([Mi 7:18‑20](https://www.esv.org/Micah+7:18/) ESV)

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
