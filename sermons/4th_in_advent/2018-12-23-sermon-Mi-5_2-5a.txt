## Old Testament [Mi 5:2‑5a ESV; sermon text]

> [2]  But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,\
> who are too little to be among the clans of Judah,\
> from you shall come forth for me\
> one who is to be ruler in Israel,\
> whose coming forth is from of old,\
> from ancient days.\
> [3] Therefore he shall give them up until the time\
> when she who is in labor has given birth;\
> then the rest of his brothers shall return\
> to the people of Israel.\
> [4] And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD,\
> in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God.\
> And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great\
> to the ends of the earth.\
> [5] And he shall be their peace.

[2] Καὶ σύ, Βηθλεεμ οἶκος τοῦ Εφραθα, ὀλιγοστὸς εἶ τοῦ εἶναι ἐν χιλιάσιν Ιουδα· ἐκ σοῦ μοι ἐξελεύσεται τοῦ εἶναι εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ, καὶ αἱ ἔξοδοι αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς ἐξ ἡμερῶν αἰῶνος. 
[3] διὰ τοῦτο δώσει αὐτοὺς ἕως καιροῦ τικτούσης τέξεται, καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ. 
[4] καὶ στήσεται καὶ ὄψεται καὶ ποιμανεῖ τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἰσχύι κυρίου, καὶ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ τοῦ ὀνόματος κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτῶν ὑπάρξουσιν· διότι νῦν μεγαλυνθήσεται ἕως ἄκρων τῆς γῆς. 
[5] καὶ ἔσται αὕτη εἰρήνη.

## Epistle [Heb 10:5‑10 ESV]

[5] Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,

> “Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,\
> but a body have you prepared for me;\
> [6] in burnt offerings and sin offerings\
> you have taken no pleasure.\
> [7] Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,\
> as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”

[8] When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), [9] then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. [10] And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 1:39‑56 ESV]

[39] In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, [40] and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. [41] And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, [42] and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! [43] And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? [44] For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. [45] And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”

[46] And Mary said,

> “My soul magnifies the Lord,\
> [47] 	and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,\
> [48] for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.\
> For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;\
> [49] for he who is mighty has done great things for me,\
> and holy is his name.\
> [50] And his mercy is for those who fear him\
> from generation to generation.\
> [51] He has shown strength with his arm;\
> he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;\
> [52] he has brought down the mighty from their thrones\
> and exalted those of humble estate;\
> [53] he has filled the hungry with good things,\
> and the rich he has sent away empty.\
> [54] He has helped his servant Israel,\
> in remembrance of his mercy,\
> [55] as he spoke to our fathers,\
> to Abraham and to his offspring forever.”
