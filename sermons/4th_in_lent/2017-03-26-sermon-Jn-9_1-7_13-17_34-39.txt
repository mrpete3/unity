## Old Testament [Is 42:14‑21 ESV]

> [14] For a long time I have held my peace;\
> I have kept still and restrained myself;\
> now I will cry out like a woman in labor;\
> I will gasp and pant.\
> [15] I will lay waste mountains and hills,\
> and dry up all their vegetation;\
> I will turn the rivers into islands,\
> and dry up the pools.\
> [16] And I will lead the blind\
> in a way that they do not know,\
> in paths that they have not known\
> I will guide them.\
> I will turn the darkness before them into light,\
> the rough places into level ground.\
> These are the things I do,\
> and I do not forsake them.\
> [17] They are turned back and utterly put to shame,\
> who trust in carved idols,\
> who say to metal images,\
> “You are our gods.”


> [18] Hear, you deaf,\
> and look, you blind, that you may see!\
> [19] Who is blind but my servant,\
> or deaf as my messenger whom I send?\
> Who is blind as my dedicated one,\
> or blind as the servant of the LORD?\
> [20] He sees many things, but does not observe them;\
> his ears are open, but he does not hear.\
> [21] The LORD was pleased, for his righteousness' sake,\
> to magnify his law and make it glorious.

## Epistle [Eph 5:8‑14 ESV]

[8] For at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light [9] (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), [10] and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. [11] Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. [12] For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. [13] But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, [14] for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,

> “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”

## Holy Gospel [Jn 9:1‑7, 13‑17, 34‑39 ESV; sermon text]

[1] As he passed by, [Jesus] saw a man blind from birth.
[2] And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
[3] Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.
[4] We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. [5] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” [6] Having said these things, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud [7] and said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.

...

[13] They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. [14] Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. [15] So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” [16] Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And there was a division among them. [17] So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”

...

[34] They answered him, “You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they cast him out.

[35] Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” [36] He answered, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” [37] Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.” [38] He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. [39] Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.”

[1] Καὶ παράγων εἶδεν ἄνθρωπον τυφλὸν ἐκ γενετῆς. 
[2] καὶ ἠρώτησαν αὐτὸν οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ λέγοντες, Ῥαββί, τίς ἥμαρτεν, οὗτος ἢ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτοῦ, ἵνα τυφλὸς γεννηθῇ; 
[3] ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς, Οὔτε οὗτος ἥμαρτεν οὔτε οἱ γονεῖς αὐτοῦ, ἀλλ' ἵνα φανερωθῇ τὰ ἔργα τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ. 
[4] ἡμᾶς δεῖ ἐργάζεσθαι τὰ ἔργα τοῦ πέμψαντός με ἕως ἡμέρα ἐστίν: ἔρχεται νὺξ ὅτε οὐδεὶς δύναται ἐργάζεσθαι. 
[5] ὅταν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ὦ, φῶς εἰμι τοῦ κόσμου. 
[6] ταῦτα εἰπὼν ἔπτυσεν χαμαὶ καὶ ἐποίησεν πηλὸν ἐκ τοῦ πτύσματος, καὶ ἐπέχρισεν αὐτοῦ τὸν πηλὸν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς 
[7] καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Υπαγε νίψαι εἰς τὴν κολυμβήθραν τοῦ Σιλωάμ {ὃ ἑρμηνεύεται Ἀπεσταλμένος}. ἀπῆλθεν οὖν καὶ ἐνίψατο, καὶ ἦλθεν βλέπων. 

...

[13] Ἄγουσιν αὐτὸν πρὸς τοὺς Φαρισαίους τόν ποτε τυφλόν. 
[14] ἦν δὲ σάββατον ἐν ἧ ἡμέρᾳ τὸν πηλὸν ἐποίησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἀνέῳξεν αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς. 
[15] πάλιν οὖν ἠρώτων αὐτὸν καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι πῶς ἀνέβλεψεν. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Πηλὸν ἐπέθηκέν μου ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς, καὶ ἐνιψάμην, καὶ βλέπω. 
[16] ἔλεγον οὖν ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων τινές, Οὐκ ἔστιν οὗτος παρὰ θεοῦ ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι τὸ σάββατον οὐ τηρεῖ. ἄλλοι [δὲ] ἔλεγον, Πῶς δύναται ἄνθρωπος ἁμαρτωλὸς τοιαῦτα σημεῖα ποιεῖν; καὶ σχίσμα ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς. 
[17] λέγουσιν οὖν τῷ τυφλῷ πάλιν, Τί σὺ λέγεις περὶ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἠνέῳξέν σου τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς; ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὅτι Προφήτης ἐστίν. 

...

[34] ἀπεκρίθησαν καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ, Ἐν ἁμαρτίαις σὺ ἐγεννήθης ὅλος, καὶ σὺ διδάσκεις ἡμᾶς; καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτὸν ἔξω. 
[35] Ἤκουσεν Ἰησοῦς ὅτι ἐξέβαλον αὐτὸν ἔξω, καὶ εὑρὼν αὐτὸν εἶπεν, Σὺ πιστεύεις εἰς τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου; 
[36] ἀπεκρίθη ἐκεῖνος καὶ εἶπεν, Καὶ τίς ἐστιν, κύριε, ἵνα πιστεύσω εἰς αὐτόν; 
[37] εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Καὶ ἑώρακας αὐτὸν καὶ ὁ λαλῶν μετὰ σοῦ ἐκεῖνός ἐστιν. 
[38] ὁ δὲ ἔφη, Πιστεύω, κύριε: καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ. 
[39] καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Εἰς κρίμα ἐγὼ εἰς τὸν κόσμον τοῦτον ἦλθον, ἵνα οἱ μὴ βλέποντες βλέπωσιν καὶ οἱ βλέποντες τυφλοὶ γένωνται.

## Introit [Ps 27:4-6; antiphon: Ps 25:15]

> My eyes are ever | toward the LORD,\*\
> for he will pluck my feet out | of the net.\
> One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek | after:\*\
> that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his | temple.\
> For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of | trouble;\*\
> he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high up- | on a rock.\
> And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with | shouts of joy;\*\
> I will sing and make melody | to the LORD.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we are constantly analyzing what has happened to others and what others do.
And what we are quickest to point out is what someone else did wrong.
You see someone in trouble and you may think,
"He brought it on himself."
And sometimes that is exactly what it is: That person does not handle his money well and now he is in financial trouble; or he smokes and now he has COPD.
He brought it on himself.
Or you may see someone in trouble and you think, "His parents caused this problem."
A tragic and common example is a pregnant mother on drugs.
In this case the parent sins and the child is born with trouble for no fault of his own.
Now when Jesus' disciples saw the man born blind,
they asked Him with their analytical minds, **“Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”** as if they got it right: either the man sinned or his parents.

> **Jesus answered, "It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him."**

God was at work, but the disciples had no clue.
Beloved in the Lord, you do not want to stand clueless before God.
You will be standing there and you will not know what is going on.

The Pharisees are worse than the disciples.
The Pharisees *claim* to know what is going on---they *claim* to know the things of God better than others.
In other words, they claim to see the things of God that others do not.
And so, they go about analyzing this report that a man born blind has received his sight.

|       THE BLIND MAN SEES AND THE PHARISEES ARE BLINDED.         |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

At first, of course, the blind man is blind---he was born blind.
The blind man is blind and the Pharisees see---they claim to see why the man was born blind.
That is the situation: the Pharisees think that they are the ones to interpret someone else's misfortune.
They are confident in it.



How will you see Jesus hanging on the Cross?
"He brought it on Himself"?

AMEN.

## Notes

Is 42:18‑21. This refers to Jacob, the unfaithful servant (v 25).

Is 42:19. Cf. Jn 9:41.

How do you look upon someone less fortunate than yourself?
"I'm sorry that person is destitute. Too bad he has a lame leg. I'm glad it's not me."
But every once in a while, the idea creeps in, "He must have done something wrong and God is punishing him."
And it is true that God brings trouble upon evildoers.
