> The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom | shal I fear?\*\
> The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I | be afraid?\
> Though an army encamp against me, my heart | shall not fear;\*\
> though war arise against me, yet I will be | confident.\
> One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek | after:\*\
> that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his | temple.\
> For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of | trouble;\*\
> he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high up- | on a rock.\

## Collect

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, Your mercies are new every morning; and though we deserve only punishment, You receive us as Your children and provide for all our needs of body and soul.
