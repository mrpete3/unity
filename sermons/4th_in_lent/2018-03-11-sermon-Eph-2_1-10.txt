## Old Testament [Nm 21:4‑9 ESV]

[4] From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way. [5] And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.” [6] Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. [7] And the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. [8] And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” [9] So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.

## Epistle [Eph 2:1‑10 ESV; sermon text]

[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
[2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—
[3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
[4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
[5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ---by grace you have been saved---[6] and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
[7] so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,
[9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[10] For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

[1] Καὶ ὑμᾶς ὄντας νεκροὺς τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν, 
[2] ἐν αἷς ποτε περιεπατήσατε κατὰ τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ κόσμου τούτου, κατὰ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ ἀέρος, τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ νῦν ἐνεργοῦντος ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς ἀπειθείας: 
[3] ἐν οἷς καὶ ἡμεῖς πάντες ἀνεστράφημέν ποτε ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις τῆς σαρκὸς ἡμῶν, ποιοῦντες τὰ θελήματα τῆς σαρκὸς καὶ τῶν διανοιῶν, καὶ ἤμεθα τέκνα φύσει ὀργῆς ὡς καὶ οἱ λοιποί: 
[4] ὁ δὲ θεὸς πλούσιος ὢν ἐν ἐλέει, διὰ τὴν πολλὴν ἀγάπην αὐτοῦ ἣν ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς, 
[5] καὶ ὄντας ἡμᾶς νεκροὺς τοῖς παραπτώμασιν συνεζωοποίησεν τῷ Χριστῷ χάριτί ἐστε σεσῳσμένοι 
[6] καὶ συνήγειρεν καὶ συνεκάθισεν ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, 
[7] ἵνα ἐνδείξηται ἐν τοῖς αἰῶσιν τοῖς ἐπερχομένοις τὸ ὑπερβάλλον πλοῦτος τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ ἐν χρηστότητι ἐφ' ἡμᾶς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ. 
[8] τῇ γὰρ χάριτί ἐστε σεσῳσμένοι διὰ πίστεως: καὶ τοῦτο οὐκ ἐξ ὑμῶν, θεοῦ τὸ δῶρον: 
[9] οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων, ἵνα μή τις καυχήσηται. 
[10] αὐτοῦ γάρ ἐσμεν ποίημα, κτισθέντες ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ἐπὶ ἔργοις ἀγαθοῖς οἷς προητοίμασεν ὁ θεὸς ἵνα ἐν αὐτοῖς περιπατήσωμεν.


## Holy Gospel [Jn 3:14‑21 ESV]

[14] "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 
[15] that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. 
[16] For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 
[17] For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. 
[18] Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. 
[19] And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 
[20] For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 
[21] But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."

## Introit [Ps 27:3-5; antiphon: Ps 27:1]

> The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom | shal I fear?\*\
> The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I | be afraid?\
> Though an army encamp against me, my heart | shall not fear;\*\
> though war arise against me, yet I will be | confident.\
> One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek | after:\*\
> that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his | temple.\
> For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of | trouble;\*\
> he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high up- | on a rock.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Few---or I would say *none* of us would ever want to be called *good for nothing*.
But for you or I to call someone *good for nothing* is something we should never do, *[Point to Sermon on the Mount window]* as Jesus teaches us in the Sermon on the Mount:

> **"Whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire."** [(Mt 5:22 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5/)

The word *fool* in Greek is *raca*, which means *empty head*.
So, though *fool* is not literally *good for nothing*, they are both words with the same intention of the heart.
Let us not call anyone *good for nothing*.
If we do, we are **liable to the hell of fire**.
(Lord Jesus, help us never to call anyone *good for nothing*. Amen.)

Let us not be the ones to call someone else good for nothing, since we believe that God **gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist** [(Rm 4:17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+4/).
In other words, we *know* God loves to take someone who is *good for nothing* and make him *great for everything*.
Thanks be to Jesus. He does this all the time!

As we direct our attention now again to the Israelites in the wilderness with Moses, we note from our Old Testament reading this morning that they had an opinion about the manna with which God graciously fed them six days a week: **“Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this _worthless_ food”** [(Nm 21:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+21/).
In other words, "This manna is good for nothing. We're sick and tired of it! And, Moses, we have the same opinion of your leadership."
Though they were certainly entitled to their opinion---everyone has an opinion---though they were certainly entitled to their opinion, their opinion *revealed their idolatry*.
They called what God had given them *worthless*, and their hearts returned to Egypt.
They had already made a golden calf and worshiped an Egyptian god.
A few chapters later, they were to worship the Baal of Peor with the Moabite women---idolatry before and idolatry after our Old Testament reading.
Their hearts had stopped trusting the God of Israel.
But their statement that manna---bread from heaven given graciously and miraculously by God to keep them alive in the wilderness---their statement that manna was worthless revealed their idolatry and made *them* worthless.

Not that *I* say they were worthless: *God* says they were worthless.
*God* says in His Word that idolaters are worthless.

> **I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols,**\
> **but I trust in the LORD.** [(Ps 31:6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+31/)

> **All worshipers of images are put to shame,**\
> **who make their boast in worthless idols.** [(Ps 97:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+97/)

God's Word clearly reveals that idols are worthless---an idol is no god at all---it cannot save us, it cannot hear us---it is a block of wood or stone or money or maybe just a rule invented by man, a figment of our imagination.
Whatever it is, our idol is worthless.
But what about us?

> **“What wrong did your fathers find in me**\
> **that they went far from me,**\
> **and went after worthlessness, and _became worthless_?"** [(Jer 2:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+2/)

God forbid that we should have an idol---(We should worship God alone, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)---God forbid that we should have an idol, but if we do, *we ourselves are worthless*---it is not nice, but it is in the Bible.
That is not *me* saying it: *God* says that idolaters are worthless.
Break the First Commandment---**You shall have no other gods before Me**---and any one of us is worthless.

Wait a minute. I have broken the First Commandment many times.
I confess that I have not feared, loved, and trusted in God above all things, and I am ashamed to say what I did when I worshiped my idols.
If I was once worthless, who am I to ever call someone else *worthless*?
That is certainly not my job!

> **And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.**

When we were idolaters we were worthless.
God forbid, but if you are an idolater now, the sooner you stop the sooner you stop serving Satan.
There, you heard it from the mouth of the apostle Paul: When we are dead in our idolatry---when we are dead in our trespasses and sins---we follow **the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience**.
When we are dead in our idolatry, we serve *Satan*, not God.
We imagine we do good, but we do not.
"But I won the Nobel Prize in Medicine!"
That is still worthless to God if you are an idolater.
"But I fed the poor and praised the name of Jesus."
Even that is still worthless to God if you are an idolater---idolaters love to bring in the name of Jesus to make their evil deeds look good.

> **[But] even when we were dead in our trespasses ...**

It is time for God to step in when we are powerless ourselves.
*Dead* means we are *dead*: we cannot even *begin* to move in any direction.
Life has to come from outside of us and come inside of us.

> **[But] even when we were dead in our trespasses, [God] made us alive together with Christ---by grace you have been saved.**

Here is how God makes us alive.
The Gospel is preached and we believe and are saved.
It is forever true that **God so loved the world, that he gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life** [(Jn 3:16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+3/). 
Believe and you *are* saved from death, and *will* live forever with Christ and His Church in heaven. Alleluia!
*[Point to Crucifixion window]* Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
Believe on Him that He has taken your sins on Himself and you are saved.
*[Point to baptismal font]* Believe and be baptized and you are saved (Mk 16:16).

What our Epistle reading reveals in multiple ways, however, is that *even our faith* which saves us is a *gift from God*.

> **For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God.**

I do not do this very often, but let me get grammatical.
Greek has three kinds of nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
If you are familiar with Spanish, Spanish has masculine and feminine, but Greek also has neuter, which is neither masculine nor feminine.

> **For by _grace_ you have been saved through _faith_. And _this_ is not your own doing; it is the gift of God.**

_Grace_ is feminine singular, _faith_ is feminine singular, and _this_ is _neuter singular_.
_This_ refers to _faith_ and _grace_.
**"_This_ is not your own doing; it is the gift of God."**
_Faith_ and _grace_, two feminine nouns are a *package* referred to by the singular pronoun _this_---the whole package is the gift of God.
_Grace_, as you learned in confirmation, means _gift_, but note this well from plain grammar: _Faith_ is included in the gift.

Beloved in the Lord, your faith in Christ is a gift of the Holy Spirit! Alleluia!
And has not Paul just finished telling us we were dead?
A dead person cannot even *begin* to believe.
We were once dead and could not even *begin* to believe, much less make a decision to believe in Christ.
God reveals to us that He makes us alive by the preaching of the Gospel---yes, He even creates our faith by the preaching of the Gospel.
Wherever the Gospel is preached, there is the Holy Spirit converting hearts from unbelief to belief.
He takes each one of us, a completely faithless person, and *makes us believers* in Christ that we be saved by faith in His name.

Now, beloved in the Lord, everything---*everything* we do by faith in His name, whether we feed the poor, discover cures for disease, or keep the toilet paper factory running---if it is done by faith in Jesus, what we do---anything and everything we do by faith---is valuable to Christ and His kingdom.
By faith in Christ, you *cannot be worthless*.
AMEN.

## Notes

Mt 5:22. *Raca* means *empty*, as in *empty-headed*.

Eph 2:8. τῇ γὰρ _χάριτί_ ἐστε σεσῳσμένοι διὰ _πίστεως_: καὶ _τοῦτο_ οὐκ ἐξ ὑμῶν, θεοῦ τὸ δῶρον. τοῦτο is nominative singular neuter; χάριτί and πίστεως are both feminine.
