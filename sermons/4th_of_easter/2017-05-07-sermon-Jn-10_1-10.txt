## First Reading [Ac 2:42‑47 ESV]

[42] And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. [43] And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. [44] And all who believed were together and had all things in common. [45] And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. [46] And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, [47] praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

## Epistle [1Pe 2:19‑25 ESV]

[19] For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. [20] For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. [21] For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. [22] He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. [23] When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. [24] He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. [25] For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 10:1‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[1] “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. [2] But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. [3] To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. [4] When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. [5] A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” [6] This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.

[7] So Jesus again said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. [8] All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. [9] I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. [10] The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, Jesus, let us return to the road to Emmaus.
Jesus appeared to Cleopas and the other disciple and as you know, but before they realized He was Jesus, **He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself** (Lk 24:27).
Jesus' teaching on the road to Emmaus is not recorded in the Bible, but last week you heard that the prophet Job spoke of Jesus when he said, **"I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God"** (Jb 19).
The prophet Moses records God's proclamation to Satan in the Garden of Eden: *"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel"** (Gn 3:15).
Jesus is the Seed of the Woman who bruises Satan's head---crushes it at His own Crucifixion.

Today I add another prophet who spoke of Jesus: Ezekiel.
Ezekiel writes in chapter 34:

> **"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep? You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep. _The weak_ you have not strengthened, _the sick_ you have not healed, _the injured_ you have not bound up, _the strayed_ you have not brought back, _the lost_ you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them. [5] So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered."** [(Ezk 34:2‑5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+34/)

The weak are the weak in faith. Jesus the Good Shepherd says, "The weak in faith, the poor in spirit, the tender in disposition are not led by commandments: 'You must do this. You must be strong.'"
For the Ten Commandments--God's Holy Law---tells us what we must do; we better keep them or face God's punishment.
But I ask you, will this strengthen the weak?
No, it will make them weaker for they lack the strength to keep God's Law.

The Good Shepherd's promise is this, proclaimed by the prophet Isaiah: **"A bruised reed [I] will not break, and a faintly burning wick [I] will not quench"** (Is 42:3 ESV).

The sick are those who do bad---those who demonstrate bad behavior.
They may be foolish, they may be easily angered, but others are surely offended by them.
Jesus calls out the false shepherds, "You left the sick sheep behind. Now I must gather them back to My flock!"
I may cast away someone who has offended me, but Jesus does not---He goes after the sick sheep.

Beloved in the Lord, if you are a weak or a sick sheep, do not despair and say you are not in the kingdom of God.
Call out to your Good Shepherd Jesus and He will come to you and you will hear His voice:

> **"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."**

> **"Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more."**

The injured are Christians who were once healthy but are now injured, as Peter was when at one time he proclaimed Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of the living God only to later deny Him three times.
There was Peter, denying Christ three times; it was as if he had a spiritual broken leg and had simply collapsed to the ground, unable to move.
Yet when Peter confessed his sin, Jesus told him, "**Feed My sheep.** As I have fed you with forgiveness by my Crucifixion, so you proclaim My Cross to the other lost sheep so that they, too, may be fed with My forgiveness."

The strayed are those who have fallen so low that all efforts to reclaim them seem to be in vain.
Take, for example, a drug addict.
Beloved in the Lord, Jesus does not narrow down His kingdom so as to only include the strong and the healthy and the perfect.
He *specializes*---He *looks* for those who are dead so that He can make them alive.
**"I am the way and the truth and _the life_."**
Do not tell Jesus that He cannot make the dead live.
Do not tell Jesus that He cannot bring back the strayed because *He can* and *He does*.
He saved a wretch like me.

The lost are those who have committed such sins that you might think they cannot be forgiven---a murderer or a pedophile. Jesus has not passed them by.

With force and harshness the false shepherds have ruled the weak, the sick, the injured, the strayed and the lost.
"You haven't kept the rules, now suffer the consequences."

Jesus is the Good Shepherd. "I suffered your consequences. I forgive you. I love you." He rules with love.

AMEN.
