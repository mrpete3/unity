> I am the good | shepherd.\*\
> I know my own and my own know me, and I lay down my life | for the sheep.\
> The LORD is my | shepherd;\*\
> I | shall not want.\
> He maketh me to lie down in green | pastures.\*\
> He leadeth me beside the still | waters.\
> He re- | storeth my soul.\*\
> He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his | name's sake.\

> Thy rod and Thy staff, they | comfort me.\
> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine | enemies;\*\
> Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup | runneth over\
> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days | of my life:\*\
> and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for- | ever.\

## Collect

Almighty God, merciful Father, since You have wakened from death the Shepherd of Your sheep, grant us Your Holy Spirit that when we hear the voice of our Shepherd we may know Him who calls us each by name and follow where He leads; through the same Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
