## First Reading [Ac 4:1-12 ESV]

[1] And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, [2] greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. [3] And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. [4] But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.

[5] On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, [6] with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. [7] And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, “By what power or by what name did you do this?” [8] Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders, [9] if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, [10] let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man is standing before you well. [11] This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. [12] And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”

## Epistle [1Jn 3:16‑24 ESV; sermon text]

[16] By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. [17] But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?
[18] Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.

[19] By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; [20] for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. [21] Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; [22] and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. [23] And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. [24] Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.

[16] ἐν τούτῳ ἐγνώκαμεν τὴν ἀγάπην, ὅτι ἐκεῖνος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἔθηκεν: καὶ ἡμεῖς ὀφείλομεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀδελφῶν τὰς ψυχὰς θεῖναι. 
[17] ὃς δ' ἂν ἔχῃ τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμου καὶ θεωρῇ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχοντα καὶ κλείσῃ τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ ἀπ' αὐτοῦ, πῶς ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ θεοῦ μένει ἐν αὐτῷ; 
[18] Τεκνία, μὴ ἀγαπῶμεν λόγῳ μηδὲ τῇ γλώσσῃ ἀλλὰ ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ. 

[19] [Καὶ] ἐν τούτῳ γνωσόμεθα ὅτι ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας ἐσμέν, καὶ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ πείσομεν τὴν καρδίαν ἡμῶν 
[20] ὅτι ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία, ὅτι μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ θεὸς τῆς καρδίας ἡμῶν καὶ γινώσκει πάντα. 
[21] Ἀγαπητοί, ἐὰν ἡ καρδία [ἡμῶν] μὴ καταγινώσκῃ, παρρησίαν ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, 
[22] καὶ ὃ ἐὰν αἰτῶμεν λαμβάνομεν ἀπ' αὐτοῦ, ὅτι τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ τηροῦμεν καὶ τὰ ἀρεστὰ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ποιοῦμεν. 
[23] καὶ αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ ἐντολὴ αὐτοῦ, ἵνα πιστεύσωμεν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ καὶ ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, καθὼς ἔδωκεν ἐντολὴν ἡμῖν. 
[24] καὶ ὁ τηρῶν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ μένει καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν αὐτῷ: καὶ ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν ὅτι μένει ἐν ἡμῖν, ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος οὗ ἡμῖν ἔδωκεν.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 10:11‑18 ESV]

[11] I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 
[12] He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. 
[13] He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. 
[14] I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, 
[15] just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
[16] And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. 
[17] For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. 
[18] No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”

## Introit [Ps 23; antiphon: Jn 10:14, 15b]

> I am the good | shepherd.\*\
> I know my own and my own know me, and I lay down my life | for the sheep.\
> The LORD is my | shepherd;\*\
> I | shall not want.\
> He maketh me to lie down in green | pastures.\*\
> He leadeth me beside the still | waters.\
> He re- | storeth my soul.\*\
> He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his | name's sake.\
> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art | with me;\*\
> Thy rod and Thy staff, they | comfort me.\
> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine | enemies;\*\
> Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup | runneth over\
> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days | of my life:\*\
> and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for- | ever.\

## Collect

Almighty God, merciful Father, since You have wakened from death the Shepherd of Your sheep, grant us Your Holy Spirit that when we hear the voice of our Shepherd we may know Him who calls us each by name and follow where He leads; through the same Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
The best known verse of the Bible is no doubt John 3:16:
**"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"** [(KJV)](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-3/).
I believe that all of you here today know that verse *3:16*.
Even amongst unbelievers, I believe this verse is widely known, second only, perhaps, to the Lord's Prayer.

Many of you also know 3:*17*:
**"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him"** [(ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+3:17/).
Now that you know 3:16, add on 3:17 and be comforted, indeed.
Jesus came to save, not condemn, and there is perhaps no better example than Jesus and the woman caught in adultery in John, chapter 8.

Now I believe this passage of the woman caught in adultery may be among the top three best known passages in the Bible.
Interestingly, this passage is absent from our lectionary---it does not appear as the Holy Gospel for any of the years in the three-year lectionary.
But if the rest of the world knows about this passage, let it be read aloud here, in church, that all may come and hear it that **God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him,** John 3:17:

> **The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to [Jesus], “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.” And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus stood up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “*Neither do I condemn you*; go, and from now on sin no more.”** [(Jn 8:3‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+8:3/)

I believe most people on the street know this passage whether they go to church or not.
I am not saying that they could tell you that it is found in John, chapter 8, but then again, maybe they can.
Holy Spirit be praised that knowledge of Christ's forgiveness of the adulteress is so widely known; may it be widely believed! Amen.
And, by the way, **"Go and sin no more."**

At the core of our Christian faith is belief that each one of us got off as easy as the woman caught in adultery.
Each one of us has been red-handed in sin---each of us, for there is none who does good, no, not even one [(Rm 3:12)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3:12/).
Though the devil would get us to sin and then accuse us of our sins, God, quite simply, would rather forgive us, like the woman caught in adultery, *but what did it cost Him*?
We have the season of Lent to think deeply about this.
But we are now in the season of Easter, so we will only remember quickly what the woman's sin cost Jesus---what your sin cost Jesus---what my sin cost Jesus.
**"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more."**
Is Jesus' forgiveness word and talk?
No, Jesus' forgiveness is deed and truth.

> **For our sake [God the Father] made [His Son] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.** [(2Co 5:21 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+5:21/)

The Old Testament sacrificial system was instituted by God to show us that sin, in deed and truth, is taken off of the sinner and put onto the sacrificial animal.
For this, the animal loses its life and its blood is spilled on the altar.
Blood, in truth, is life itself:

> **For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.** [(Lv 17:11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+17:11/)

*Atonement* means that God is not angry at sin anymore.
But what did it cost Him?
In deed, it cost the Father His Son.
In deed, it cost the Son His life, His blood---the holy, innocent blood shed on the Cross in punishment for our sins in the most miserable of circumstances; especially that, bearing our sins, *He became sin for us*---He was forsaken by His Father as we should be for our sins.
Our Lord Jesus, in deed, took all of our deserved misery in our place and gave us His life in exchange for our misery.
In deed, He sacrificed all to keep us safe!

Remember Jesus our Good Shepherd.
He saw the wolf coming---the devil---to lie to us and get us to stray from the flock, which all of us do at some time or another---to lie to us and get us to stray from the flock so he can gobble us up---turn us away from God and life and light to darkness and death and hell.
Well, what did, God, our Good Shepherd *do*?
Did He run away because He could care less for the sheep?
No, He attacked and disarmed the wolf with heavenly force and in the process gave up His own life: **"I lay down My life for the sheep"** [(Jn 10:15)](https://www.esv.org/John+10:15/)---demonstrating love with such power and so many facets that our days are now filled with holy meditation on God's love.
God's love, essentially, is *sacrifice* shown on the Cross.
We know it.
So, when we confess that **God so _loved_ the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,**
we see that love demonstrated _on the Cross_---love is sacrifice; we know what it is.
Beloved in the Lord, for us, love is not a fuzzy feeling.
Love is Christ dying on the Cross, pleading for our forgiveness, which He secures by seeing it through to the end.
**"It is finished"** [(Jn 19:30)](https://www.esv.org/John+19:30/).

All who believe in Him He baptizes in His name and in the name of His Father and the Holy Spirit, who love and constantly care for us.
There is utterly no condemnation in this love for all is forgiven at the Cross.
There is only a loving Father rushing to His repentant child to welcome him back into the house [(Lk 15:20)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+15:20/) and angels celebrating in heaven [(Lk 15:7)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+15:7/).
No condemnation; lots of love and acceptance.

> **By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?**

Now having believed in our Lord Jesus and being saved by His name, and living in God's love and acceptance, there is just one more thing: the *other* 3:16‑17. Our Epistle lesson: *1 John 3:16‑17*:

> **By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?**

What do we have that we could sacrifice for someone else and
why do we care?
Because there is nothing else that we would rather do than to honor our Lord Jesus, who first loved us.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
