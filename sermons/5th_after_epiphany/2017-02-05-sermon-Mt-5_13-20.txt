## Old Testament [Is 58:3‑9a ESV]

> [3] ‘Why have we fasted, and you see it not?\
> Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?’\
> Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure,\
> and oppress all your workers.\
> [4] Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight\
> and to hit with a wicked fist.\
> Fasting like yours this day\
> will not make your voice to be heard on high.\
> [5] Is such the fast that I choose,\
> a day for a person to humble himself?\
> Is it to bow down his head like a reed,\
> and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?\
> Will you call this a fast,\
> and a day acceptable to the LORD?

> [6] “Is not this the fast that I choose:\
> to loose the bonds of wickedness,\
> to undo the straps of the yoke,\
> to let the oppressed go free,\
> and to break every yoke?\
> [7] Is it not to share your bread with the hungry\
> and bring the homeless poor into your house;\
> when you see the naked, to cover him,\
> and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?\
> [8] Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,\
> and your healing shall spring up speedily;\
> your righteousness shall go before you;\
> the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.\
> [9] Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;\
> you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’

## Epistle [1Co 2:1‑16 ESV]

[1] And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom. [2] For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. [3] And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, [4] and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, [5] so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.

[6] Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away. [7] But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. [8] None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. [9] But, as it is written,

> “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,\
> nor the heart of man imagined,\
> what God has prepared for those who love him”—
	
	
[10] these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. [11] For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. [12] Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. [13] And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.

[14] The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. [15] The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. [16] “For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 5:13‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[13] “You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.

[14] “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. [15] Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. [16] In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

[17] “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. [18] For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. [19] Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. [20] For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

[13] Ὑμεῖς ἐστε τὸ ἅλας τῆς γῆς: ἐὰν δὲ τὸ ἅλας μωρανθῇ, ἐν τίνι ἁλισθήσεται; εἰς οὐδὲν ἰσχύει ἔτι εἰ μὴ βληθὲν ἔξω καταπατεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων. 

[14] Ὑμεῖς ἐστε τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου. οὐ δύναται πόλις κρυβῆναι ἐπάνω ὄρους κειμένη: 
[15] οὐδὲ καίουσιν λύχνον καὶ τιθέασιν αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τὸν μόδιον ἀλλ' ἐπὶ τὴν λυχνίαν, καὶ λάμπει πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ. 
[16] οὕτως λαμψάτω τὸ φῶς ὑμῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅπως ἴδωσιν ὑμῶν τὰ καλὰ ἔργα καὶ δοξάσωσιν τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν τὸν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς. 

[17] Μὴ νομίσητε ὅτι ἦλθον καταλῦσαι τὸν νόμον ἢ τοὺς προφήτας: οὐκ ἦλθον καταλῦσαι ἀλλὰ πληρῶσαι. 
[18] ἀμὴν γὰρ λέγω ὑμῖν, ἕως ἂν παρέλθῃ ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ, ἰῶτα ἓν ἢ μία κεραία οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου ἕως ἂν πάντα γένηται. 
[19] ὃς ἐὰν οὖν λύσῃ μίαν τῶν ἐντολῶν τούτων τῶν ἐλαχίστων καὶ διδάξῃ οὕτως τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, ἐλάχιστος κληθήσεται ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν: ὃς δ' ἂν ποιήσῃ καὶ διδάξῃ, οὗτος μέγας κληθήσεται ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν. 
[20] λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ περισσεύσῃ ὑμῶν ἡ δικαιοσύνη πλεῖον τῶν γραμματέων καὶ Φαρισαίων, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we are drawing near to the end of the Epiphany season, and, as you know, one of the highlights of the Epiphany season has been the ministry of John the Baptist, preparing the way for the Lord.

> **But when [John] saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? _Bear fruit in keeping with repentance_.”** [(Mt 3:7‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+3/)

A harsh message, indeed, for the Pharisees and Sadducees came out of Jerusalem into the wilderness to see John just to be called a brood of vipers!
They probably wanted a refund on their bus ticket.
They probably wished they had stayed home after a welcome like that.
But John uses that harsh, direct language that sinners coming to his baptism should indeed fear the wrath of God's judgment, "but don\'t just *act* like you repent, *bear fruit in keeping with* repentance."

Let us pause on that important Biblical point: John the Baptist calls for *bearing fruit in keeping with repentance*.
You know what that means: do not go right back and just repeat that sin that you repented of---at least put up a fight!
Have any of you been deceived by the devil to think,
"I'll just confess my sin, God will forgive me, and I do not have to give up anything."
*[Illustration]* Imagine a thief who comes to confession.
"Pastor, I confess that I have stolen a car."

The pastor says, "Do you believe that my forgiveness is God's forgiveness?"

"Yes."

"Let it be done for you as you believe.
In the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ I forgive you all your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

The next week the man is back. "Pastor, I confess that I stole another car, but I swear this is the last one."

The man's first confession was a confession that did not bear any fruit keeping with repentance.
His second confession indicates at least that he wants to do better.
*Bearing fruit keeping with repentance* is why, in our rite of Individual Confession and Absolution, you are directed to say,
"I am sorry for all of this and ask for grace. *I want to do better*," opening the door, of course, for the wonderful working of the Holy Spirit in your life, who wants nothing more than to scrub you clean.

*Bearing fruit in keeping with repentance* is Christian piety by which we honor our Lord Jesus Christ.
John the Baptist emphasizes it and we embrace it.
When we say we confess our sins, we mean that we confess *and forsake* our sins, as is written in Proverbs 28:13---confess and forsake our sins so that we receive by faith God's mercy in Jesus Christ.

**"You brood of vipers"**---you would think that these words were John the Baptist's set-up for the soft, comforting words of Jesus, for He comes with forgiveness and would never call anyone *brood of vipers*.

Think again.

> **"You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."** [(Mt 12:34 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+12/)

That is *Jesus* speaking, in Matthew, chapter 12, not John the Baptist.
But then how can our Lord say, **"You brood of vipers,"** on one hand, but then on the other hand in our Holy Gospel say, **"You are the salt of the earth, ... You are the light of the world"**?

**"You are the salt of the earth"** is a complement.
Taken as an illustration of taste, salt makes food taste better.
What would food be without taste?
(Maybe the soup I cook. I need to brush off Dorothy Montick's recipes.)
Much of our lives amounts to memory of the last time I had something good to eat and thinking about the next time I will have something good to eat.
Salt, by enhancing flavor, plays a part in making something good to eat.

By faith in Him, He speaks very highly of You.

AMEN.
