## Old Testament [Is 40:21‑31 ESV]

> [21] Do you not know? Do you not hear?\
> Has it not been told you from the beginning?\
> Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?\
> [22] It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,\
> and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;\
> who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,\
> and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;\
> [23] who brings princes to nothing,\
> and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.

> [24] Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,\
> scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,\
> when he blows on them, and they wither,\
> and the tempest carries them off like stubble.

> [25] To whom then will you compare me,\
> that I should be like him? says the Holy One.\
> [26] Lift up your eyes on high and see:\
> who created these?\
> He who brings out their host by number,\
> calling them all by name;\
> by the greatness of his might\
> and because he is strong in power,\
> not one is missing.

> [27] Why do you say, O Jacob,\
> and speak, O Israel,\
> “My way is hidden from the LORD,\
> and my right is disregarded by my God”?\
> [28] Have you not known? Have you not heard?\
> The LORD is the everlasting God,\
> the Creator of the ends of the earth.\
> He does not faint or grow weary;\
> his understanding is unsearchable.\
> [29] He gives power to the faint,\
> and to him who has no might he increases strength.\
> [30] Even youths shall faint and be weary,\
> and young men shall fall exhausted;\
> [31] but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength;\
> they shall mount up with wings like eagles;\
> they shall run and not be weary;\
> they shall walk and not faint.

## Epistle [1Co 9:16‑27 ESV; sermon text]

[16] For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! [17] For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship. [18] What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.

[19] For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. [20] To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. [21] To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. [22] To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. [23] I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.

[24] Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. [25] Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. [26] So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. [27] But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.

[16] ἐὰν γὰρ εὐαγγελίζωμαι, οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα: ἀνάγκη γάρ μοι ἐπίκειται: οὐαὶ γάρ μοί ἐστιν ἐὰν μὴ εὐαγγελίσωμαι. 
[17] εἰ γὰρ ἑκὼν τοῦτο πράσσω, μισθὸν ἔχω: εἰ δὲ ἄκων, οἰκονομίαν πεπίστευμαι. 
[18] τίς οὖν μού ἐστιν ὁ μισθός; ἵνα εὐαγγελιζόμενος ἀδάπανον θήσω τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, εἰς τὸ μὴ καταχρήσασθαι τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ μου ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ. 

[19] Ἐλεύθερος γὰρ ὢν ἐκ πάντων πᾶσιν ἐμαυτὸν ἐδούλωσα, ἵνα τοὺς πλείονας κερδήσω: 
[20] καὶ ἐγενόμην τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις ὡς Ἰουδαῖος, ἵνα Ἰουδαίους κερδήσω: τοῖς ὑπὸ νόμον ὡς ὑπὸ νόμον, μὴ ὢν αὐτὸς ὑπὸ νόμον, ἵνα τοὺς ὑπὸ νόμον κερδήσω: 
[21] τοῖς ἀνόμοις ὡς ἄνομος, μὴ ὢν ἄνομος θεοῦ ἀλλ' ἔννομος Χριστοῦ, ἵνα κερδάνω τοὺς ἀνόμους: 
[22] ἐγενόμην τοῖς ἀσθενέσιν ἀσθενής, ἵνα τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς κερδήσω: τοῖς πᾶσιν γέγονα πάντα, ἵνα πάντως τινὰς σώσω. 
[23] πάντα δὲ ποιῶ διὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, ἵνα συγκοινωνὸς αὐτοῦ γένωμαι. 

[24] Οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι οἱ ἐν σταδίῳ τρέχοντες πάντες μὲν τρέχουσιν, εἷς δὲ λαμβάνει τὸ βραβεῖον; οὕτως τρέχετε ἵνα καταλάβητε. 
[25] πᾶς δὲ ὁ ἀγωνιζόμενος πάντα ἐγκρατεύεται, ἐκεῖνοι μὲν οὖν ἵνα φθαρτὸν στέφανον λάβωσιν, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἄφθαρτον. 
[26] ἐγὼ τοίνυν οὕτως τρέχω ὡς οὐκ ἀδήλως, οὕτως πυκτεύω ὡς οὐκ ἀέρα δέρων: 
[27] ἀλλὰ ὑπωπιάζω μου τὸ σῶμα καὶ δουλαγωγῶ, μή πως ἄλλοις κηρύξας αὐτὸς ἀδόκιμος γένωμαι.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 1:29‑39 ESV]

[29] And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. [30] Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. [31] And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.

[32] That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. [33] And the whole city was gathered together at the door. [34] And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.

[35] And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. [36] And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, [37] and they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.” [38] And he said to them, “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.” [39] And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.

## Introit [Ps 13:3-5; antiphon: Ps 13:6]

> I will sing | to the LORD,\*\
> because he has dealt bountifully | with me.\
> Consider and answer me, O | LORD my God;\*\
> light up my eyes, lest I sleep the | sleep of death,\
> lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed | over him,"\*\
> lest my foes rejoice because I am | shaken.\
> But I have trusted in your | steadfast love;\*\
> my heart shall rejoice in your sal- | vation.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Our Epistle readings in Epiphany continue in 1 Corinthians, written by the apostle Paul.
Our Gospel readings continue in the Gospel of Mark, where Jesus revealed Himself by getting right to work.
That is the impression you get from Mark's Gospel: Jesus is here and He wastes no time in getting things done.

> **And _immediately_ [Jesus] left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and _immediately_ they told him about her. And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.** [(Mk 1:29‑31)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+1/)

*Immediately*, *immediately*, *immediately* is what you hear about Jesus in Mark's Gospel.
Our Lord did not dillydally around!
Simon, as you know, was later given the name Peter; Simon became the apostle Peter [(Mk 3:16)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+3/).
St. Peter's mother-in-law was sick with a fever and one of Jesus' first miracles, but not the very first, was to simply take her hand, lift her up, and take away her fever.
It is not recorded that Jesus spoke any words to heal her---He may have just given her His hand; she believed and was healed.
Jesus knew who He was---He *is* God who has power over sin, sickness, and demons---and if He wants Peter's mother to be healed He can do it.
He knows who He is.
But do you?

Years later, after His Crucifixion and Resurrection, He still knew who He was, but also the doubting apostle Thomas, who touched Jesus' hands and side exclaimed, **"My Lord and my God!"** [(Jn 20:28 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+20/).
Not only did doubting Thomas know who Jesus was but many eyewitnesses of His Resurrection.
But there was one who did *not* know who Jesus is.
There was a *famous* example of one who would, if he could, wipe the memory of our resurrected Christ from the history of mankind.
And that was Saul.
Saul, as you know, was later given the name Paul; he became the apostle Paul [(Ac 13:9)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+13/).
He would have, if he could have, wiped the memory of our crucified and resurrected Lord from the history of mankind and wiped out his followers.
He tried to do it.
He was there, abetting the stoning of the first Christian martyr, Stephen.

Yet, as you remember, the Christ whom he persecuted appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus, and *immediately* Paul knew who Jesus is.
And when Paul was converted, do your remember what Jesus said about him?
**"I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of My name"** [(Ac 9:16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+9/).
This is the signature of Paul's ministry: **"I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of My name."**

In this light, I want to remind you of what Paul has already written to the Corinthians:

> **For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.** [(1Co 4:9‑13 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+4/)


Did not Jesus say, **"I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of My name"**?
Do you think Paul ever forgot how much *he* made *others* suffer for the name of Jesus?
He made others suffer for Jesus, and now it has returned to him.
But to Paul this is pure joy.

And here is the Epiphany message today for you.
What is the difference between Jesus shining forth in your hear and His *not* shinging forth in your heart.
How would Paul have felt if he were **the scum of the world, the refuse of all tings** *without* Jesus shining in his heart---Jesus, his Savior *from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil*?
He would have felt like **the scum of the world, the refuse of all things**.
But *with* Jesus in his heart, He *knows* things are not what they seem.
Though he *seems* like **the scum of the world, the refuse of all things**,
he *knows* that he is an heir of heaven.

> **Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.**

Paul's eyes are set on the prize: the prize of an imperishable inheritance in heaven.
He paints us as athletes in training and that our self-control while suffering, our self-control while being persecuted for the name of Christ, is training for God's kingdom.
I hope you see that two people can be in the same miserable situation: one a believer and the other an unbeliever.
To the unbeliever, it is misery, but the the believer, it is the joy of training, knowing that the Lord is disciplining him to have stronger faith that stands under rain, flood, and wind [(Mt 7:24‑25)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+7/).


But is Paul miserable over suffering for Jesus?
Is Paul weary for what he has to put up with for the sake of Jesus?
No!

> **What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.**

Paul's reward is to preach the Gospel free of charge for all his trouble.
Though he, as an apostle of Christ, is **the scum of the world, the refuse of all things,** his reward is to know who Jesus is---*true God begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the virgin Mary*.
Paul's reward is to know who Jesus is and serve Him.
(The reason why we have youth confirmation and adult instruction is that we all may also know who Jesus is and serve Him.)
He is my Lord *who has redeemed  me, a lost and condemned person, purchased and won me from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil; not with gold or silver, but with His holy, precious blood and with His innocent suffering and death.*
Though Paul, an apostle of Christ, is **the scum of the world, the refuse of all things,** his reward is to present the Gospel free of charge, even though
**those who proclaim the Gospel should get their living by the Gospel** [(1Co 9:14)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+9/).

And do you think Paul ever forgot how much *he* made *others* suffer for the name of Jesus?
I do not think he did; I believe he wanted never to bring such suffering again.
Imagine what suffering he would bring if he did *not* proclaim the Gospel to lost sinners: "**Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!**
What will these people suffer if I do *not* tell them of the one who saves them from hell? I better do whatever it takes to win some.

> **"For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew ... To those under the law I became as one under the law ... To those outside the law I became as one outside the law ... To the weak I became weak ... I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some."**

AMEN.

## Notes

Is 40:26. Who created these stars?

Is 40:31. God's promise of endurance.

Lk 10:13‑15. [13] “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. [14] But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. [15] And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.
