## Old Testament [Zec 9:9‑12 ESV]

> [9] Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!\
> Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!\
> Behold, your king is coming to you;\
> righteous and having salvation is he,\
> humble and mounted on a donkey,\
> on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\
> [10] I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim\
> and the war horse from Jerusalem;\
> and the battle bow shall be cut off,\
> and he shall speak peace to the nations;\
> his rule shall be from sea to sea,\
> and from the River to the ends of the earth.\
> [11] As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you,\
> I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.\
> [12] Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope;\
> today I declare that I will restore to you double.

## Epistle [Rm 7:14‑25a ESV]

[14] For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. [15] For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. [16] Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. [17] So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. [18] For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. [19] For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. [20] Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.

[21] So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. [22] For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, [23] but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. [24] Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? [25a] Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!

## Holy Gospel [Mt 11:25‑30 ESV; sermon text]

[25] At that time Jesus declared, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; [26] yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. [27] All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. [28] Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. [29] Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. [30] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”

[25] Ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν, Ἐξομολογοῦμαί σοι, πάτερ, κύριε τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς, ὅτι ἔκρυψας ταῦτα ἀπὸ σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν καὶ ἀπεκάλυψας αὐτὰ νηπίοις: 
[26] ναί, ὁ πατήρ, ὅτι οὕτως εὐδοκία ἐγένετο ἔμπροσθέν σου. 
[27] Πάντα μοι παρεδόθη ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐπιγινώσκει τὸν υἱὸν εἰ μὴ ὁ πατήρ, οὐδὲ τὸν πατέρα τις ἐπιγινώσκει εἰ μὴ ὁ υἱὸς καὶ ᾧ ἐὰν βούληται ὁ υἱὸς ἀποκαλύψαι. 
[28] Δεῦτε πρός με πάντες οἱ κοπιῶντες καὶ πεφορτισμένοι, κἀγὼ ἀναπαύσω ὑμᾶς. 
[29] ἄρατε τὸν ζυγόν μου ἐφ' ὑμᾶς καὶ μάθετε ἀπ' ἐμοῦ, ὅτι πραΰς εἰμι καὶ ταπεινὸς τῇ καρδίᾳ, καὶ εὑρήσετε ἀνάπαυσιν ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν: 
[30] ὁ γὰρ ζυγός μου χρηστὸς καὶ τὸ φορτίον μου ἐλαφρόν ἐστιν.

## Introit [Ps 91:2, 9-10; antiphon: Ps 91:1]

> He who dwells in the shelter of the | Most High\*\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, let us begin this morning with a reminder---a reminder of who Jesus is and *what He had to put up with* while He sojourned here on earth.
For the prophet Isaiah foretold who Jesus is hundreds of years before He was born of Mary:

> **For to us a child is born,**\
> **to us a son is given;**\
> **and the government shall be upon his shoulder,**\
> **and his name shall be called _Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,_**\
> **_Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace_.** [(Is 9:6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+9/)

Jesus is God, and He knew this very well.
*[Point to boy-Jesus-in-the-temple window.]* Even as a twelve-year-old child, He stayed behind in Jerusalem after the Passover and had Bible talks with the most learned men of his day.
His parents, Joseph and Mary, were worried because they had already headed home to Nazareth and thought Jesus was with them.
The teachers in the temple were amazed at this boy's questions and answers---"How can this uneducated 12-year-old boy be as educated as we are about the Bible?"
When Joseph and Mary finally found their son in the temple, Mary said, **"Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress."**
Do you remember Jesus' answer?
**"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that _I must be in my Father's house_?"**
Jesus knew who He was and what He was doing even as a 12-year-old, and He was annoyed with His parents for good reason.
He was not rebellious: He knew He was the Son of God.
Nevertheless, Jesus willingly returned back home to Nazareth with His parents and was submissive to them [(Lk 2:41‑51)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2/).

*[Point to Baptism window.]* When Jesus was baptized, the Father's voice was heard from heaven and the Holy Spirit alighted upon Him as a dove.
Jesus was not surprised or amazed---He *knew* that He was the Son, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit are one God, world without end.
Nevertheless, He *wanted* to be baptized *with sinners* and *for sinners* [(Lk 3:21‑22)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+3/).

Then the Spirit led Him out into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan [(Lk 4:1‑13)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4/).
Never forget, beloved in the Lord, that He had to put up with that!

After being tempted, and knowing full-well that He is Wonderful Counselor and Mighty God, Jesus went back to His hometown of Nazareth to teach in the synagogue.
He opened the scroll of Isaiah and read,

> **“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,	because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."** [(Lk 4:18‑19 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4/)

Great news for anyone who would listen! Are you physically blind? Jesus has come to give you your sight.
Are you spiritually blind?
Jesus has come to baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
Are you oppressed by the devil?
Jesus has come to give you rest.
Not a message of mere hope---Christ teaches the folks at home, **"Today this Scripture has been _fulfilled_ in your hearing"** [(Lk 4:21 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4/).
"Whatever hope you have had for God to save you, *your hope is here---your hope is fulfilled now, right here before your eyes. I am your Savior.*"

Yet what did Jesus have to put up with even then?

> **They rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.** [(Lk 4:29 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4/)

For coming to save them, the folks at home wanted to *kill* Him.
In Nazareth, they tried to kill Him, *[Point to Crucifixion window.]* but in Jerusalem, they did: they finally crucified Him.

Beloved in the Lord, let us continue now with a reminder of who *we* are and what we have to put up with while you sojourn here on earth.
We will take our reminder from today's Epistle reading.
**"I am of the flesh, sold under sin"** [(Rm 7:14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+7/).
Each and every one of us is born with sin and we cannot help *but* sin.
That is what the Bible calls *the flesh*: our flesh is that part us us infected by sin, sold under sin.
When our flesh hears God's Ten Commandments, we want to break them.
When our flesh is offended, we seed revenge.
Our flesh is a coiled snake within us ready to strike not as instruments of God's good and gracious will, but as instruments of Satan's shame.
Our flesh is our greatest burden while we sojourn here on earth.

> **For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.** [(Rm 7:19‑20 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+7/)

Add to that the fact the everyone around us also walks in the flesh and we have a perfect recipe for misery.
And finally, our flesh must die.

> **Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?** [(Rm 7:24 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+7/)

Does this mean that we must go the same path that Jesus did?
Yes, but we must interpret our suffering and death not according to the flesh, but according to our faith that Jesus is our Savior.
Our Savior Jesus, who bore our sins on the Cross and was raised from the dead, turns death into life.
Does He not tell us in our Holy Gospel today, **"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."**

Jesus came as God, yet was crucified as a sinner.
We come as burdened sinners sentenced to die, yet we are declared innocent and immortal.
This is the rest that Jesus gives to us.
When we come to Him our burden of sin is totally lifted and we are given a new yoke---a new burden that is not a burden at all.
And that burden is to live as happy children in Christ's kingdom.
AMEN.
