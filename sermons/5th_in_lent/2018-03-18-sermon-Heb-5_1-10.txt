## Old Testament [Jer 31:31‑34 ESV]

[31] “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, [32] not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. [33] For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. [34] And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”

## Epistle [Heb 5:1‑10 ESV; sermon text]

[1] For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. [2] He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. [3] Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people. [4] And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.

[5] So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him,

> “You are my Son, today I have begotten you”;

[6] as he says also in another place,

> “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.”

[7] In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. [8] Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. [9] And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, [10] being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.

[1] Πᾶς γὰρ ἀρχιερεὺς ἐξ ἀνθρώπων λαμβανόμενος ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων καθίσταται τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν, ἵνα προσφέρῃ δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίας ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν, 
[2] μετριοπαθεῖν δυνάμενος τοῖς ἀγνοοῦσιν καὶ πλανωμένοις, ἐπεὶ καὶ αὐτὸς περίκειται ἀσθένειαν, 
[3] καὶ δι' αὐτὴν ὀφείλει καθὼς περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ οὕτως καὶ περὶ αὐτοῦ προσφέρειν περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν. 
[4] καὶ οὐχ ἑαυτῷ τις λαμβάνει τὴν τιμήν, ἀλλὰ καλούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ, καθώσπερ καὶ Ἀαρών. 

[5] Οὕτως καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς οὐχ ἑαυτὸν ἐδόξασεν γενηθῆναι ἀρχιερέα, ἀλλ' ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς αὐτόν,

> Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε: 

[6] καθὼς καὶ ἐν ἑτέρῳ λέγει,

> Σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ. 

[7] ὃς ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ, δεήσεις τε καὶ ἱκετηρίας πρὸς τὸν δυνάμενον σῴζειν αὐτὸν ἐκ θανάτου μετὰ κραυγῆς ἰσχυρᾶς καὶ δακρύων προσενέγκας καὶ εἰσακουσθεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλαβείας, 
[8] καίπερ ὢν υἱὸς ἔμαθεν ἀφ' ὧν ἔπαθεν τὴν ὑπακοήν: 
[9] καὶ τελειωθεὶς ἐγένετο πᾶσιν τοῖς ὑπακούουσιν αὐτῷ αἴτιος σωτηρίας αἰωνίου, 
[10] προσαγορευθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ ἀρχιερεὺς κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 10:32‑45 ESV]

[32] And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, [33] saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles.
[34] And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.”

[35] And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” [36] And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” [37] And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” [38] Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” [39] And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, [40] but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” [41] And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. [42] And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. [43] But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, [44] and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. [45] For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
We are only a week away from Palm Sunday, and Holy Week is just around the corner.
May the Holy Spirit bless us, as He always does, with a rich and a memorable Holy Week and a joyous celebration of the Resurrection of our Lord.
It is coming! Easter is just around the corner.
Although we can already taste the celebration, we remember that there is still serious business ahead.
And our Lord Jesus knows it.

> **And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, saying, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise."** [(Mk 10:32‑33 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+10/)

And you may recall that the turning point in Luke's Gospel, chapter 9, verse 31, is this:

> **When the days drew near for him to be taken up, [Jesus] set his face to go to Jerusalem.** [(Lk 9:51 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+9/)

Jesus is going up to Jerusalem to *do His job*---to do what He became a man to do---Jesus is going up---uphill, that is---to Jerusalem---to Mt. Zion, Mt. Moriah---to do His job, *to serve as Priest*.
You may have heard before that Jesus is Prophet, Priest, and King; today is about Jesus serving as our *Priest*.
From our Epistle reading we hear,

> **For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God** (that is what a priest does) **, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people. And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.**

Let us make this clear: Jesus had no sins of His own, but the sons of Aaron did.
In the book of Hebrews, we are reminded of the Old Testament priesthood of Aaron and his sons.
No one else was to serve as priests other than Aaron and his sons.

But you may recall that God had said of all the Israelites,
**"You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; _and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation_."** [(Ex 19:4‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+19/).
Though God said that the entire Israelite nation was a kingdom of priests, that *did not mean* that they served in the tabernacle priesthood---only Aaron and his sons were called to do that.

This, by the way, is made perfectly clear in the case of Korah's rebellion, recorded in Numbers, chapter 16.
Korah was a Levite---God called Levites to serve at the tabernacle but not as priests because only Aaron and his sons were called to do that.
Listen to Korah's complaint to Moses and Aaron:

> **“You have gone too far! For _all_ in the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”** [(Nm 16:3 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+16/)

In other words, "Who made you the boss, Moses and Aaron? God said we're all priests."
By the way, Korah was not alone: he had 250 chiefs to back him up---Korah had strong political support.
Korah and 250 Israelite leaders all agreed that Moses and Aaron had gone too far and *presumed* to have authority that God had not given them.

Do you remember what happened to Korah and those who agreed with him?
Moses said, "Alright, alright. Let's burn incense tomorrow and the LORD will show us who is His" (Nm 16:7).

> **And Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi: is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do service in the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the congregation to minister to them, and that he has brought you near him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? _And would you seek the priesthood also?_ Therefore it is against _the LORD_[, not me,] that you and all your company have gathered together. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?”** [(Nm 16:8‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+16/)

Do you remember what happened then to Korah and his followers?
They wanted to be priests, but the LORD had not *called* them to be priests.
They did not respect Moses' authority, either.

> **And Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own accord. If these men die as all men die, or if they are visited by the fate of all mankind, _then the LORD has not sent me_. But if the LORD creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the LORD.”**

> **And as soon as he had finished speaking all these words, the ground under them split apart. And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the people who belonged to Korah and all their goods. So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.** [(Nm 16:28‑33 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+16/)

So, beloved in the Lord, our Epistle reading says, **"No one takes this honor [of being a priest] for himself, _but only when called by God_, just as Aaron was,"** and good for you if you remember Korah's rebellion, which is the biblical case in point.
If you do *not* remember Korah's rebellion, I invite you to study your Bible---read, mark, and inwardly digest it regularly at home or please join us for our regular Bible studies Sundays at 11 and Wednesdays at 4:30.
Those who participate, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, grow in the knowledge of the Scriptures, which make us wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
Study the Bible not to make you smarter, but to *know what God says and keep it in your heart*.
Beloved in the Lord, may the Word of God dwell richly in your hearts!

And the Word of God reveals that Jesus is called by God---called by His Father---to serve as Priest---Prophet, _Priest_, and King.
Jesus does not pop up and say, "I was praying under a tree and My Father told me, 'I want You to be a priest today.' So, everyone, watch me improvise as your Priest."
No, Jesus is called by His Father to serve as priest of the order of *Melchizedek*.

> **So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, “You are my Son, today I have begotten you”; as he says also in another place, “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.”**

I have mentioned the Aaronic priesthood---the Old Testament temple priesthood of Aaron and his sons.
Jesus comes to serve us not by the Aaronic priesthood, but by the *Mechizedek* priesthood.
The name *Melchizedek* itself says something: *Melchizedek* means *king of righteousness*.
We had said Prophet, Priest, and King.
Well with Melchizedek we have two of three: Priest and King.
When Melchizedek appears in Genesis, chapter 14 to bless Abraham, he is identified as the king of ... (Do you remember?) ... the king of *Salem*---the king of *peace*.
So, by coming to us as a priest like Melchizedek, we already know Him to be not only our Priest, but also our King of righteousness and peace.

By peace, we must observe one more thing---that Jesus is not only Priest but also perfect, sinless *Sacrifice*.
You see that Jesus as Priest bundles a whole lot---*everything* for our salvation---*everything* so that *His* sacrifice of *His* own body is **the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him**.

At this point, and in conclusion, we will add one more aspect of our Lord's priesthood.
He was *obedient* to His Father in His priesthood, and the Scripture says we are saved by obedience to Him.
In your thinking, perhaps, you may associate *obedience* with following rules, which is *not* how we are saved.
It is clear that we have not kept God's rules---God's holy Ten Commandments---and if our salvation depends on this kind of obedience, we are lost.
The Greek word for obedience literally means *listen under* or *under listen*.
Obedience that saves us is none other than listening---listening and believing.

Our Lord Jesus listened to His Father at all times---the Son completely trusts His Father and listens to Him.
*[Point to Gethsemane window.]* In the Garden of Gethsemane, it is especially clear that Jesus asks His Father *not* to suffer on the Cross but His Father says, "Do it. Trust Me."
And Jesus goes to the Cross without complaint, trusting His Father---listening under his Father.
Our faith is to listen under our Lord Jesus, and thereby gain His Father's favor.
When Jesus listened, He perfected our salvation---He brought it to a perfect end by which one single sacrifice atoned for the sin of not just one person, not just a few, but He atoned for the sin of all of mankind.
That is perfect!
When we listen, faith is created by which that salvation---all of it---is ours.
AMEN.
