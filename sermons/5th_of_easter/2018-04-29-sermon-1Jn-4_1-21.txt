O God, You make the minds of Your faithful to be of one will. Grant that we may love what You have commanded and desire what You promise, that among the many changes of this world our hearts may be fixed where true joys are found; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, T our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
