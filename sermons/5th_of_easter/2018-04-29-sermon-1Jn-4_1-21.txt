## First reading [Ac 8:26‑40 ESV]

[26] Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is a desert place. [27] And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship [28] and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. [29] And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.” [30] So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” [31] And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. [32] Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this:

> “Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter\
> and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,\
> so he opens not his mouth.\
> In his humiliation justice was denied him.\
> Who can describe his generation?\
> For his life is taken away from the earth.”

[34] And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?” [35] Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. [36] And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?” [38] And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. [39] And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. [40] But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.


## Epistle [1Jn 4:1‑21 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[2] By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, [3] and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. [4] Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. [5] They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. [6] We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

[13] By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. [14] And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. [15] Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. [16] So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. [17] By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. [18] There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. [19] We love because he first loved us. [20] If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. [21] And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.

[1] Ἀγαπητοί, μὴ παντὶ πνεύματι πιστεύετε, ἀλλὰ δοκιμάζετε τὰ πνεύματα εἰ ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν, ὅτι πολλοὶ ψευδοπροφῆται ἐξεληλύθασιν εἰς τὸν κόσμον. 
[2] ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκετε τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ θεοῦ: πᾶν πνεῦμα ὃ ὁμολογεῖ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυθότα ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν, 
[3] καὶ πᾶν πνεῦμα ὃ μὴ ὁμολογεῖ τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ οὐκ ἔστιν: καὶ τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου, ὃ ἀκηκόατε ὅτι ἔρχεται, καὶ νῦν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ἐστὶν ἤδη. 
[4] ὑμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστε, τεκνία, καὶ νενικήκατε αὐτούς, ὅτι μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ ἐν ὑμῖν ἢ ὁ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ. 
[5] αὐτοὶ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου εἰσίν: διὰ τοῦτο ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου λαλοῦσιν καὶ ὁ κόσμος αὐτῶν ἀκούει. 
[6] ἡμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐσμεν: ὁ γινώσκων τὸν θεὸν ἀκούει ἡμῶν, ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ οὐκ ἀκούει ἡμῶν. ἐκ τούτου γινώσκομεν τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης. 

[7] Ἀγαπητοί, ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἀγαπῶν ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ γεγέννηται καὶ γινώσκει τὸν θεόν. 
[8] ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν οὐκ ἔγνω τὸν θεόν, ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν. 
[9] ἐν τούτῳ ἐφανερώθη ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν, ὅτι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ ἀπέσταλκεν ὁ θεὸς εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἵνα ζήσωμεν δι' αὐτοῦ. 
[10] ἐν τούτῳ ἐστὶν ἡ ἀγάπη, οὐχ ὅτι ἡμεῖς ἠγαπήκαμεν τὸν θεόν, ἀλλ' ὅτι αὐτὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἱλασμὸν περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν. 
[11] Ἀγαπητοί, εἰ οὕτως ὁ θεὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἡμεῖς ὀφείλομεν ἀλλήλους ἀγαπᾶν. 
[12] θεὸν οὐδεὶς πώποτε τεθέαται: ἐὰν ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, ὁ θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν μένει καὶ ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν τετελειωμένη ἐστιν. 

[13] Ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ μένομεν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν ἡμῖν, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ δέδωκεν ἡμῖν. 
[14] καὶ ἡμεῖς τεθεάμεθα καὶ μαρτυροῦμεν ὅτι ὁ πατὴρ ἀπέσταλκεν τὸν υἱὸν σωτῆρα τοῦ κόσμου. 
[15] ὃς ἐὰν ὁμολογήσῃ ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, ὁ θεὸς ἐν αὐτῷ μένει καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ θεῷ. 
[16] καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐγνώκαμεν καὶ πεπιστεύκαμεν τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἔχει ὁ θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν. Ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν, καὶ ὁ μένων ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ ἐν τῷ θεῷ μένει καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἐν αὐτῷ μένει. 
[17] ἐν τούτῳ τετελείωται ἡ ἀγάπη μεθ' ἡμῶν, ἵνα παρρησίαν ἔχωμεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς κρίσεως, ὅτι καθὼς ἐκεῖνός ἐστιν καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ τούτῳ. 
[18] φόβος οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ, ἀλλ' ἡ τελεία ἀγάπη ἔξω βάλλει τὸν φόβον, ὅτι ὁ φόβος κόλασιν ἔχει, ὁ δὲ φοβούμενος οὐ τετελείωται ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ. 
[19] ἡμεῖς ἀγαπῶμεν, ὅτι αὐτὸς πρῶτος ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς. 
[20] ἐάν τις εἴπῃ ὅτι Ἀγαπῶ τὸν θεόν, καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ μισῇ, ψεύστης ἐστίν: ὁ γὰρ μὴ ἀγαπῶν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ὃν ἑώρακεν, τὸν θεὸν ὃν οὐχ ἑώρακεν οὐ δύναται ἀγαπᾶν. 
[21] καὶ ταύτην τὴν ἐντολὴν ἔχομεν ἀπ' αὐτοῦ, ἵνα ὁ ἀγαπῶν τὸν θεὸν ἀγαπᾷ καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ.


## Holy Gospel [Jn 15:1‑8 ESV]

[1] "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 
[2] Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 
[3] Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. 
[4] Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. 
[5] I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 
[6] If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. 
[7] If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 
[8] By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples."

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
We have hit upon the subject in Bible study and we have it again in today's Epistle reading:

> **Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but _test the spirits_ to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.**

**Test the spirits** because some of them teach Satan's lies.
But what about human opinion?
Is human opinion in any way influenced by the Holy Spirit or evil spirits?
If it is not, then then there is nothing more than one person thinks one way and another person thinks another way.
If it is, then one person thinks God's way and another person thinks the devil's way.
There is a difference!
And there is a lot at stake whether or not you acknowledge spiritual influence on human opinion.
Are our opinions under spiritual influence from the Holy Spirit or evil spirits or are our thoughts our own private domain that we are able to protect from the outside?
Even if we were protected from the outside, the Bible teaches us to be beware of the inside: **"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?"** from [Jeremiah, chapter 17](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+17:9/).
Though I would agree that everyone is entitled to his opinion, the Bible *assumes* that each of us is born with a deceitful heart, inclined to evil, and that the devil's evil spirits are active to trick us to get us to do what the devil wants us to do.
What do I mean?
I mean that evil spirits, for example, want us to form the opinion that a child conceived in his mother's womb is not a person and can be put to death.
What do I mean?
I mean, what does *Jesus* mean when He says in the Holy Gospel, in John, chapter 15, verse 5, **"Apart from me you can do nothing"** [(Jn 15:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+15:5/)?
Whatever Jesus means, that is what I mean.
I can do no good apart from Jesus.
He comes into my sinful, deceitful heart, proclaims that He, in the flesh, has redeemed me from my slavery to Satan, and gives me His Holy Spirit with His Baptism.
I have been born from above---Alleluia! I have risen with Christ---and can now begin to serve Him in His kingdom in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness.

Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, but in our Epistle reading, the Holy Spirit directs us to test the spirits because the *spirit of the antichrist* is in the world *already*, and we do not want to get tied up with the antichrist.
Who, then, is the antichrist?
What does the Bible tell us about the antichrist?
Hear what St. John says about the antichrist two chapters previous to our Epistle reading:

> **Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. *They went out from us*, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us.** [(1Jn 2:18‑19 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+2:18/)

*Us* means the apostles and the church the Holy Spirit established through their preaching and teaching as recorded in the book of Acts.
Christ's Church has always taught and believed the same thing.
Some, however, have gone out to teach something different; these are antichrists.
St. John says the antichrist is coming and now is the last hour---that was 2000 years ago!
It was the last hour then at it is the last hour now---that is how Christians live---as if our Lord is returning tonight like a thief in the night.
We do not know the hour of our Lord's return [(Mk 13:32)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+13:32/).
We do not know precisely who the antichrist is, but we know where he comes from:the antichrist comes from the Church: **"They went out from us, but they were not of us."**
And just like that, St. John goes from speaking about one antichrist to several antichrists.
Did you notice that?
He does the same switch in 2 John; this time he switches from several antichrists to one antichrist:

> **For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a *one* is the deceiver and the antichrist.** [(2Jn 7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+John+1:7/)

So there is one antichrist just as there are several antichrists; that is how the Bible speaks.
It appears that there is one antichrist who has the power to direct several antichrists.
The *one* antichrist does not seem to be either of the two beasts in Revelation, because those are described to be worldly leaders.
But the *one* antichrist may fit the *man of lawlessness* described by St. Paul in 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2:

> **Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the _man of lawlessness_ is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.** [(2Th 2:3‑4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+Thessalonians+2:3/)

The man of lawlessness **_exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship_**---sounds like he he may be the one come out of the Church and move "up the ranks" and say he is over everything. (The man of lawlessness could be the pope.)
The antichrists **went out from us, but they were not of us**.
There is the similarity between the man of lawlessness and the antichrists, or antichrist.
May the Holy Spirit grant us discernment not to follow them but to follow the faith that the apostles have always taught.

> **Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.** [(2Jn 8‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+John+1:8/)

We are trained in school and perhaps by society to respect everyone's opinion, but here we are warned by Christ's own apostle that opinions can be dangerous and originate from evil spirits while others originate from the Holy Spirit.
Be warned that what we see and hear is not just one person's opinion against another's---it is not just what one person thinks and another person thinks.
Evil spirits and the Holy Spirit are involved in what people say and do.
St. Paul writes in Ephesians, chapter 6:

> **Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.** [(Eph 6:11‑12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+6:11/)

Repent.
In the light of the devil's power over us, what a dangerous thing it is not to repent, and what a wonderful thing it is to repent.
Should the devil know that we have not repented of our sin, how will his evil spirits approach you?
"Being delinquent on your taxes isn't a sin. Looking at pornography isn't a sin. Gossiping on Facebook isn't  a sin. Not helping my neighbor in need isn't a sin. Not doing my best at work isn't a sin."
Every unconfessed, unrepented sin presents the devil with a big steel hook coming out of our side: "Here, Satan, throw a rope of the this hook and yank on it."
Every unconfessed, unrepented sin presents an opportunity for the evil spirits to tell us something we want to hear---it is okay to keep sinning.
Repent or you'll listen to the spirit of the antichrist who wants to make you feel better about your sinning.

Repent and hear the message of love.
The message that definitely originates from the Holy Spirit is love.

> **"For God so *loved* the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"** [(KJV)](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-3/).

> **This is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.**

God's love is revealed not as an idea, but as His Son dying in the flesh to pay for our sins.
Beloved in the Lord, believe it and never forget it!
Jesus Christ came in the flesh---He is Son of God and Son of Man.
The Father has revealed His love in that He gave us His Son.
The Son has revealed His love in that He gave us is life as a propitiation for our sins.
Sacrifice.
God's love is revealed to us as *sacrifice*.
The Holy Spirit would have love perfected not only *for* us, but *within* us.

> **Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.**

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

## Notes

Let us hear more about the antichrist from St. John:

> **Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.** [(1Jn 2:22 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+2:22/)

So let us just leave it at that: St. John goes from speaking of one antichrist to many antichrists in the same breath.
The Holy Spirit has spoken.
Who is *the* antichrist, the tool of the devil.

Do what we see and hear originate from the Holy Spirit or from the devil?
That is the question.

"Aw, c'mon."

Seriously. We are dealing with the spirit of the antichrist.
If we listen to the antichrist we are in peril of being turned away from Christ to false belief, despair, and other great shame and vice---peril of, God forbid, forsaking Christ and going to hell!
Beloved in the Lord, we do not want to get tied up with the antichrist.
Help us heavenly Father, and pour out on us your Holy Spirit that testifies of Your Son and saves us from being deceived by the spirit of the antichrist!

Allow me to begin with an example from the Bible: Caiaphas.

"Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try."

Open minded.
