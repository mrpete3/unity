## First Reading [Ac 16:9-15 ESV]

[9] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” [10] And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
[11]  So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, [12] and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days. [13] And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. [14] One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. [15] And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us.

## Epistle [Rv 21:9-14, 21-27 ESV; sermon text]

[9] Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.” [10] And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, [11] having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. [12] It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed— [13] on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. [14] And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
[21] And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
[22] And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. [23] And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. [24] By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, [25] and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. [26] They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. [27] But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

O God,
You make the minds of Your faithful to be of one will.
Grant that we may love what You have commanded

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, the book of Revelation is written ultimately to comfort Christ's Church and to reveal to you Jerusalem, your happy home, your heavenly home—a place so beautiful that it is well worth anything you may suffer here on earth.

*[Illustration]* The first Christian martyr, as you may recall, was Stephen.
He had preached a wonderful sermon, covering the breadth of the Bible to show that Jesus of Nazareth was the Righteous One announced by the prophets and killed by the very ones who had received God's law but did not keep it [(Ac 7)](http://www.esvbible.org/Acts+7/).
Stephen's hearers were enraged, but as you may recall,
heaven opened and Stephen saw the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.
As Stephen was dying, he called out, **“Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” And falling to his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep.**

Seeing heaven was Stephen's comfort when dying, and you can think of the book of Revelation in the same way,
for the book of Revelation tells us clearly that there will be much killing, and what began with Stephen will continue among us before the Last Day.

> **When [the Lamb] opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.**

> **When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne. They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.** [(Rv 6:7‑11 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Revelation%206%3A7-11/)

There are reports even today that ISIS is targeting Christians and other religious minorities with rape, enslavement, and death.
President Obama has, in fact, declared this as [genocide of Christians](http://aclj.org/persecuted-church/aclj-launches-seven-point-plan-in-campaign-to-stop-isis-genocide-against-christians), but I am unaware of our government taking action to protect them.
Help them, Father, and protect them yourself with your right arm and your Spirit!
Even today, the white robes are being passed out and the martyrs are being told to rest **until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been**.
Beloved in the Lord, that may include us, says the book of Revelation,
and we should not doubt the Lord's protection and blessing even if we should be martyred.

> **Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.”**

Beloved in the Lord, through the forgiveness of sins in the name of Jesus, this is all yours!
This vision is to comfort you in your final hour, whether your are martyred or die peacefully in hospice.
And, beloved in the Lord, I can tell you as your pastor that *this is my number one priority*: that you are there.
The Holy Spirit has called me to shepherd you to that place—to hold up the Cross of Jesus and take you from Unity Lutheran Church to New Jerusalem.
That is my number one concern: that you are there among the multitude dressed in white robes, praising Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
That is why I am here.

I will teach the best I can. I will preach the best I can. I will visit you the best I can and pray that I bring some comfort in the name of Jesus.
But any comfort now is only a foretaste of the comfort that is yet to come.

>  **“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”**

Beloved in the Lord, what you have by faith in Jesus is the only thing you need be concerned about.

> **“The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son.”**

AMEN.
