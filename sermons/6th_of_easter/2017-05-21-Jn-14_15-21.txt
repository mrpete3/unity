## First Reading [Ac 17:16‑31 ESV]

[16] Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. [17] So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. [18] Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, “What does this babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. [19] And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? [20] For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.” [21] Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.

[22] So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. [23] For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: ‘To the unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. [24] The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, [25] nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. [26] And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, [27] that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, [28] for

> “‘In him we live and move and have our being’;

as even some of your own poets have said,

> “‘For we are indeed his offspring.’

[29] Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man. [30] The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, [31] because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”

## Epistle [1Pe 3:13‑22 ESV]

[13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.

[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 14:15‑21 ESV; sermon text]

[15] “If you love me, you will keep my commandments. [16] And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, [17] even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.

[18] “I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. [19] Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. [20] In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. [21] Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.” [22] Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we are coming to the end of the Easter season and will celebrate Pentecost---the pouring out of the Holy Spirit---in only two weeks.
Our Lord Jesus, after His Resurrection, had a few things to say.
You pay special attention to the words of someone who knows he is going to die.
For example, when our own Al Evans knew he was going to die, he called all of his children into his room at Parma Hospital and told them to take care of Gert, his wife and their mother.
His children paid special attention his words and they did what Al told them to do: they took care of Gert right up to her final hour.
But what about the words of a man who is not about to die but has been *raised from the dead*?
What does He have to say? We want to know!
These are the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of God crucified for our sins and raised for our justification (Rm 4:25)---these are the words---the Word of our resurrected Lord Jesus that we pay special attention to during the Easter season.

You may recall that our Lord Jesus testifies of *peace* during the forty days of His Resurrection appearance. When the disciples were hiding behind locked doors for fear of the Jews, Jesus, demonstrating the fantastic properties of His brand-new *resurrected body*, came through the doors or the walls or the windows or the ceiling or the floor---He appeared out of nowhere unhindered by solid matter and said **"Peace be with you"** (Jn 20:19).

So, not only does our resurrected Lord Jesus testify of peace but at the same time He *testifies of His body*: **"Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe"** [(Jn 20:27 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+20/).
Our Lord's resurrected body is a bodily testimony of peace, for the Old Testament prophets clearly testify that the LORD **"will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day"** (Zec 3:9)---remove the sin *of this land*, that is, *everyone's* sins---remove the iniquity of this land *in a single day*---He will exercise such power and effect that in one day, everyone's sins are thown out---your charges are thown out.
Christ died on that single day **bearing our sins in His body on the tree**---**bearing our sins in His body on the tree** of the Cross (1Pe 2:24).
By His death on that single day, our sins are removed *by that single day*, which for good reason we call *Good* Friday.
Our Lord's resurrected body is a testimony of peace because His body, which bore our sins, died---our sins were punished in full.
However, take note: His body, which bore our sins has no trace of death anymore, no trace of sin anymore, and by His declaration of **"Peace,"** *He makes no mention of our sins anymore* to say, **"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more"** [(Jn 8:11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+8/).

Do not doubt your forgiveness, just as certain as Jesus is risen from the dead! Alleuia!

And finally, and what our Lord emphasizes going forward for all who believe in Him, is that *the Holy Spirit is coming*.
Jesus points toward Pentecost and says, "You may be joyous that I defeated death, but there's more: the *Holy Spirit is coming*."


> **[Jesus] breathed on [the disciples] and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.”** (Jn 20:22‑23 ESV)

> **"If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you."**

To love Jesus and keep His commandments is a new obedience.
You cannot love Him as He loved you, for what can He possibly need your mercy for?
*But you have received mercy.* What are you to do? *Listen to Him---keep His commandments---keep His Word*.

> **So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’”** (Lk 17:10 ESV)

AMEN.

## Notes

Ac 17:18. Footnote from *LSB Study Bible*: "Epicurianism emphasized seeking a pleasurable life, though not merely in a sensual way. Stoicism stressed the rational order of nature and urged people to accept their fate within it." In a way, the Epicureans and Stoics were opposites.

Ac 17:24‑25. Cf. Is 42:5; Ps 50.

Ac 17:28. Paul is probably quoting pagan poets.

Ac 17:31. Christ's Resurrection is the sign that He will judge the world.

1Pe 3:15‑16. Testify of Christ with gentleness and respect. Not *if* you are slandered: *when* you are slandered.

1Pe 3:18. *The righteous for the unrighteous. Put to death in the flesh, made alive in the spirit.*

1Pe 3:19. "It is enough if we know that Christ descended into hell, destoyed hell for all believers, and delivered them from the power of death and of the devil, from eternal condemnation and the jaws of hell.
We will save our questions and not curiously investigate about how this happened until the other world. Then not only this mystery, but others also will be revealed that we simply believe here and cannot grasp with our blind reason" (FC Ep IX 4).

1Pe 3:19‑20. The life we were given in Baptism was earned by Christ, cf. Rm 6:4.
