## First Reading [Ac 10:34-48 ESV]

[34] So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, [35] but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. [36] As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), [37] you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: [38] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. [39] And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, [40] but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, [41] not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. [42] And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. [43] To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
[44] While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. [45] And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. [46] For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, [47] “Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” [48] And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.

## Epistle Reading [1Jn 5:1-8]

[1] Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. [2] By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. [3] For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. [4] For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. [5] Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
[6] This is he who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. [7] For there are three that testify: [8] the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree. 

## Holy Gospel [Jn 15:9‑17 ESV]

[9] As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. [10] If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. [11] These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.
[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another.

## Introit [Ps 66:1-2, 8-9, 20; antiphon: Ps. 66:16]

> Come and hear, all you who | fear God,\*\
> and I will tell what he has done | for my soul.\
> Shout for joy to God, | all the earth;\*\
> sing the glory of his name; give to him | glorious praise!\
> Bless our God, O | peoples;\*\
> let the sound of his | praise be heard,\
> who has kept our soul among the | living\*\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Today, already, is the Sixth Sunday of Easter.
Easter Sunday was the First Sunday of Easter, so Easter was five weeks, 35 days ago.
What does this mean?
We will be saying, "Easter was 40 days ago" on Friday,
and Jesus ascended into heaven 40 days after His Resurrection.
But here is the catch.
Why, then, is Ascension on *Thursday*, not Friday.
(Yes, we are starting the sermon with a math lesson.)
Ascension is on Thursday, 40 days after Easter.
You will run into this over and over again: in the Bible, you start counting on *Day 1*.
When I calculated Friday to be 40 days after Easter, I counted Easter as Day 0, the Monday after Easter as Day 1.
When the Bible counts, Easter is *Day 1*.
And that is the difference: the Bible starts counting on Day 1 and we start counting on Day 0.
Counting from Easter Sunday as Day 1, Ascension is this *Thursday*.

We will look forward to Christ's Ascension today and celebrate is next week.
Jesus teaches us that the jobs of the Holy Spirit is to emphasize Christ's Ascension.
Let us take a look at Christ's teaching about the work of the Holy Spirit:

> **And when [the Holy Spirit] comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.** [(Jn 16:8‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+16:8/)

Now is a good time to bring the Holy Spirit into view as well because Pentecost comes up only ten days after Ascension.
For those who do not believe in Jesus, the Holy Spirit graciously convicts them of sin.
For those of *us* whose faith is wavering and we are fading into sin and unbelief, the Holy Spirit is there to convict us of having sinned against God's Holy Ten Commandments:

1. **Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.**
1. **Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain.**
1. **Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.**
1. **Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.**
1. **Thou shalt not kill.**
1. **Thou shalt not commit adultery.**
1. **Thou shalt not steal.**
1. **Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.**
1. **Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.**
1. **Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.**

The Holy Spirit graciously convicts us concerning sin *every day*.
Beloved in the Lord, this is a beautiful thing, for
**there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents** [(Lk 15:10 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+15:10/).
By the grace of the Holy Spirit, may *we* be the ones who cause a party to break out in heaven.

The Holy Spirit graciously convicts us concerning righteousness.
_[Illustration]_ Remember your greatest honor.
Did you receive an academic award?
Did you graduate?
Did you win a trophy?
Were you promoted at your job?
I am proud of you and you should be proud.
But which of us has been taken up into heaven?
Now *that* is an honor.

Actually, we know from the Bible that there are two people who were taken up into heaven without going through earthly death.
The first is Enoch: **"Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him"** [(Gn 5:24 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+5:24/).
That is all we know; what a beautiful thing it is to walk with God.
The second to be taken straight to heaven is the prophet Elijah:
**"And as [Elijah and Elisha] still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven"** (2Ki 2:11 ESV).
We know that these men so pleased God that they got a heavenly promotion.

You can say the same thing about our Lord's Ascension: Christ so pleased His Father that He got a heavenly promotion.
What is an earthly promotion---one that we may be proud of---compared to a heavenly promotion? The heavenly promotion is much better.

For God to promote someone to heaven has to do with righteousness.
Righteous ones are promoted to heaven and unrighteous ones are demoted to hell, where the fire is not quenched and the worm does not die.
Contrary to anything the devil whispers in our ears against Christ, what righteousness is there to deny about Christ if He was promoted into heaven in plain, public sight?
*Christ did right*, and He ascended---He was promoted to heaven.

Now the difference between Enoch and Elijah, on the one hand, and Christ on the other hand, is that Christ's Ascension comes with *promises for us*.

> **You ascended on high,**\
> **leading a host of captives in your train**\
> **and receiving gifts among men,**\
> **even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.** [(Ps 68:18 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+68:18/)

Who are the host of captives that Jesus leads to heaven along with Him?
You and I: His Church.
We were once captives of the devil, but by the grace of the Holy Spirit, we now believe in Christ as our Redeemer from the devil.
He bought us with His blood from slavery to Satan.
We were once captives of the devil, but we are now captives of Christ, and Psalm 68 prophesies that Jesus takes captive to heaven with Him.
By faith in Christ, you are already a captive in heaven, where He sits at the right hand of the Father. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
