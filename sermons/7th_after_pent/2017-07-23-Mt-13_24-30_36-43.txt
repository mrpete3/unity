## Old Testament [Is 44:6‑8 ESV]

> [6] Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel\
> and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts:\
> “I am the first and I am the last;\
> besides me there is no god.\
> [7] Who is like me? Let him proclaim it.\
> Let him declare and set it before me,\
> since I appointed an ancient people.\
> Let them declare what is to come, and what will happen.\
> [8] Fear not, nor be afraid;\
> have I not told you from of old and declared it?\
> And you are my witnesses!\
> Is there a God besides me?\
> There is no Rock; I know not any.”

## Epistle [Rm 8:18‑27 ESV]

[18] For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. [19] For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. [20] For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope [21] that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. [22] For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. [23] And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. [24] For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? [25] But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

[26] Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. [27] And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 13:24‑30, 36‑43 ESV; sermon text]

[24] He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, [25] but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. [26] So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. [27] And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’ [28] He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ [29] But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. [30] Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”

[36] Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” [37] He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. [38] The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, [39] and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. [40] Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. [41] The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, [42] and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. [43] Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

[24] Ἄλλην παραβολὴν παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς λέγων, Ὡμοιώθη ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ σπείραντι καλὸν σπέρμα ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ αὐτοῦ. 
[25] ἐν δὲ τῷ καθεύδειν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἦλθεν αὐτοῦ ὁ ἐχθρὸς καὶ ἐπέσπειρεν ζιζάνια ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σίτου καὶ ἀπῆλθεν. 
[26] ὅτε δὲ ἐβλάστησεν ὁ χόρτος καὶ καρπὸν ἐποίησεν, τότε ἐφάνη καὶ τὰ ζιζάνια. 
[27] προσελθόντες δὲ οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ οἰκοδεσπότου εἶπον αὐτῷ, Κύριε, οὐχὶ καλὸν σπέρμα ἔσπειρας ἐν τῷ σῷ ἀγρῷ; πόθεν οὖν ἔχει ζιζάνια; 
[28] ὁ δὲ ἔφη αὐτοῖς, Ἐχθρὸς ἄνθρωπος τοῦτο ἐποίησεν. οἱ δὲ δοῦλοι λέγουσιν αὐτῷ, Θέλεις οὖν ἀπελθόντες συλλέξωμεν αὐτά; 
[29] ὁ δέ φησιν, Οὔ, μήποτε συλλέγοντες τὰ ζιζάνια ἐκριζώσητε ἅμα αὐτοῖς τὸν σῖτον. 
[30] ἄφετε συναυξάνεσθαι ἀμφότερα ἕως τοῦ θερισμοῦ: καὶ ἐν καιρῷ τοῦ θερισμοῦ ἐρῶ τοῖς θερισταῖς, Συλλέξατε πρῶτον τὰ ζιζάνια καὶ δήσατε αὐτὰ εἰς δέσμας πρὸς τὸ κατακαῦσαι αὐτά, τὸν δὲ σῖτον συναγάγετε εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην μου.

[36] Τότε ἀφεὶς τοὺς ὄχλους ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν. καὶ προσῆλθον αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ λέγοντες, Διασάφησον ἡμῖν τὴν παραβολὴν τῶν ζιζανίων τοῦ ἀγροῦ. 
[37] ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν, Ὁ σπείρων τὸ καλὸν σπέρμα ἐστὶν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου: 
[38] ὁ δὲ ἀγρός ἐστιν ὁ κόσμος: τὸ δὲ καλὸν σπέρμα, οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς βασιλείας: τὰ δὲ ζιζάνιά εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ πονηροῦ, 
[39] ὁ δὲ ἐχθρὸς ὁ σπείρας αὐτά ἐστιν ὁ διάβολος: ὁ δὲ θερισμὸς συντέλεια αἰῶνός ἐστιν, οἱ δὲ θερισταὶ ἄγγελοί εἰσιν. 
[40] ὥσπερ οὖν συλλέγεται τὰ ζιζάνια καὶ πυρὶ [κατα]καίεται, οὕτως ἔσται ἐν τῇ συντελείᾳ τοῦ αἰῶνος: 
[41] ἀποστελεῖ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ, καὶ συλλέξουσιν ἐκ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ σκάνδαλα καὶ τοὺς ποιοῦντας τὴν ἀνομίαν, 
[42] καὶ βαλοῦσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν κάμινον τοῦ πυρός: ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων. 
[43] Τότε οἱ δίκαιοι ἐκλάμψουσιν ὡς ὁ ἥλιος ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν. ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκουέτω.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, Jesus teaches us in Matthew, chapter 13 about the kingdom of God;
to teach about the kingdom of God, He tells us parables about sowing seed in a wheat field.
Just as the Bible teaches us about sheep and shepherds, but we may have little experience with sheep and shepherds, so also Jesus teaches us about seed and sowers.
You may have little experience sowing wheat seed, but there are plenty of wheat fields in Ohio.
They are sown with machines, however, and not by hand.
_[Humor]_ To sow a wheat seed by hand, just take a needle and thread and stick the needle through the wheat seed ... just kidding.
To sow wheat seed by hand, take a fistful of it out of the sack and throw it so that it sprays all over the soil.
Then you leave it there and pray for it to rain and for the seed to grow.

This is how Jesus begins these parables:

> **"A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them."** [(Mt 13:3‑4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

In other words, a fistful of seed misses the cultivated soil and winds up on the path,
where the birds swoop in and eat it up.
To explain this parable, Jesus says,

> **"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path."** [(Mt 13:19 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

The evil one is the same one we pray against in the Lord's Prayer: **but deliver us from evil**---**deliver us from the _evil one_**---*deliver us from the devil*.
The devil is real.
But here is something I find peculiar.
I have recently met a couple who believe that there is no hell.
They even kindly brought me a book that teaches that hell is not real.
Yet in our Holy Gospel today, Jesus says, **"The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."**
How you reconcile our Lord's plain words about the fiery furnance and weeping and gnashing of teeth with *There is no hell* I have no idea.
Hell is real.

Just his week I met a woman who believes there is no sin.
Again, **"The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom _all causes of sin_ and all law-breakers."**
Sin is those things that we have done that make God angry for which he goes to great measures to put an end to it.
We have not failed: we have not failed *to sin*---each and every one of us.
And at this point, let us stop, plant our feet, *[Hold hands up.]* hold our hands up and confess that the Bible reveals to us *Christ crucified for our sins*.

> **He was pierced for our transgressions;**\
> **He was crushed for our iniquities;**\
> **upon Him was the chastisement that brought us peace,**\
> **and with His wounds we are healed.** [(Is 53:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53/)

If there is no sin, then there is no Christ who died for our sins.
And if there is no Christ who died for our sins, now you have a problem with plain history.
The greatest historical record of anything having happened on the planet 2,000 years ago is that there was a man named Jesus of Nazareth who lived in Palestine and was crucified under the Roman governor Pontius Pilate.
Jesus was believed to be a prophet and a holy man.
After His Crucifixion, He was seen alive again in public and the people got very excited.
The name of Jesus went viral before there was an Internet.
His apostles proclaimed His name as having salvation over sin, death, and hell---they proclaimed the name of Jesus without fear of death.
But if you believe there is no sin, the point is that you have *a lot* of history to debunk about Jesus and the interpretation of His historical death and Resurrection.

Interestingly, though I have recently been told there is no hell---though I have recently been told there is no sin---no one has told me there is no devil.
Satan is someone whom few have seen face to face, but whom we believe to be real because the Bible tells us he is real and he sure seems to be real once we learn of lying and murder in this world (Jn 8:44).
For example, "Try this heroin, you'll feel better."
And soon you are dead.
A peculiar pattern I have begun to notice is that many of these new teachers seem to respect the name of Satan.

Beloved in the Lord, let us flee from the name of Satan and cling to the name of Jesus Christ!
Returning to the sowing of seed,

> **"Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away."** [(Mt 13:5‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

To explain this, Jesus teaches,

> **"As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises _on account of the word_, immediately he falls away."** [(Mt 13:20‑21 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

But there is more seed sown to trouble.

> **"Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them."** [(Mt 13:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

To explain this, Jesus says,

> **"As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful."** [(Mt 13:22 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

At this point, the seed is clearly identified as *God's Word*.
These parables teach what can happen when God's Word is sown in your heart,
and may it not be that the devil snatches it away, may it not be that it sprouts but then withers and dies, may it not be that it is choked out by the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of this world: by the grace of the Holy Spirit, may it be *this* kind of seed:

> **"Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. He who has ears, let him hear."** [(Mt 13:8‑9 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

And to explain the seed that grows and produces grain, Jesus teaches,

> **"As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty."** [(Mt 13:23 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

Our Holy Gospel today continues this teaching own sowing seed.

> **"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also."**

Jesus reveals this enemy to be Satan again.
The worst thing you can do if you have an enemy is to pretend he does not exist.
If you lived next door to a violent man and said, "He's a nice guy,"
guess who is going to the be the first person he hurts? You.
Satan is real.
In our parables about sowing seed, he does double duty,
First, he snatches the seed that has fallen on the path---he snatches away *the word of the kingdom* that has been sown in a sinners heart.
I have a theory of how this works in reality: distraction.
Have you ever been told something but you cannot remember what it was because you were thinking about something else?
You were distracted.
Satan plays mind games in your head, and it usually involves your sin or someone else's sin.
He can get you to flip over the same useless thoughts over and over again so it is like you have flipped a pancake twenty times.
Your mind has been occupied burning a single pancake in such a way that if God wants to convict you of your sin, you cannot listen.
Your mind has been spinning round and round over once subject in such a way that if God wants to proclaim to you the death of His Son to atone for your sins, you think you have something more important to listen to and you miss your salvation.
Satan has you and drags you down to hell.
Distraction is serious business.

One example of distraction can be this question? *Why doesn't God stop all these evil people and get rid of them?*
Some of you might get wound up about the presence of evil people in the world?
Jesus tells us in the Holy Gospel that evil people are seed sown by the devil.

> **So the servants said to [the sower], "Then do you want us to go and gather them?" But he said, "No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them."**

God knows what He is doing.
He is letting the evil people exist because if He weeded them out now, children of the kingdom would be uprooted, too.
There, what need is there to be distracted about evil people?

> **The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.**

Just as hell, the devil, and demons are real. So are angels---God's *good* angels.

> **Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?** (Heb 1:14 ESV)

But today we learn that they will be busy separating children of Jesus from children of Satan on the Last Day.
Your relief will come when the angels have finished sorting everyone out:

> **Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.**

AMEN.
