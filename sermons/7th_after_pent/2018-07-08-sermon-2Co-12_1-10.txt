## Old Testament [Ezk 2:1‑5 ESV]

[1] And he said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.” [2] And as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. [3] And he said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day. [4] The descendants also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’ [5] And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that a prophet has been among them."

## Epistle [2Co 12:1‑10 ESV; sermon text]

[1] I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. [2] I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven---whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. [3] And I know that this man was caught up into paradise---whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows---[4] and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. [5] On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses---[6] though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.
[7] So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.
[8] Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. [9] But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. [10] For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

[1] Καυχᾶσθαι δεῖ: οὐ συμφέρον μέν, ἐλεύσομαι δὲ εἰς ὀπτασίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεις κυρίου. 
[2] οἶδα ἄνθρωπον ἐν Χριστῷ πρὸ ἐτῶν δεκατεσσάρων εἴτε ἐν σώματι οὐκ οἶδα, εἴτε ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα, ὁ θεὸς οἶδεν ἁρπαγέντα τὸν τοιοῦτον ἕως τρίτου οὐρανοῦ. 
[3] καὶ οἶδα τὸν τοιοῦτον ἄνθρωπον εἴτε ἐν σώματι εἴτε χωρὶς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα, ὁ θεὸς οἶδεν 
[4] ὅτι ἡρπάγη εἰς τὸν παράδεισον καὶ ἤκουσεν ἄρρητα ῥήματα ἃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἀνθρώπῳ λαλῆσαι. 
[5] ὑπὲρ τοῦ τοιούτου καυχήσομαι, ὑπὲρ δὲ ἐμαυτοῦ οὐ καυχήσομαι εἰ μὴ ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις. 
[6] ἐὰν γὰρ θελήσω καυχήσασθαι, οὐκ ἔσομαι ἄφρων, ἀλήθειαν γὰρ ἐρῶ: φείδομαι δέ, μή τις εἰς ἐμὲ λογίσηται ὑπὲρ ὃ βλέπει με ἢ ἀκούει [τι] ἐξ ἐμοῦ 
[7] καὶ τῇ ὑπερβολῇ τῶν ἀποκαλύψεων. διό, ἵνα μὴ ὑπεραίρωμαι, ἐδόθη μοι σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί, ἄγγελος Σατανᾶ, ἵνα με κολαφίζῃ, ἵνα μὴ ὑπεραίρωμαι. 
[8] ὑπὲρ τούτου τρὶς τὸν κύριον παρεκάλεσα ἵνα ἀποστῇ ἀπ' ἐμοῦ: 
[9] καὶ εἴρηκέν μοι, Ἀρκεῖ σοι ἡ χάρις μου: ἡ γὰρ δύναμις ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ τελεῖται. ἥδιστα οὖν μᾶλλον καυχήσομαι ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις μου, ἵνα ἐπισκηνώσῃ ἐπ' ἐμὲ ἡ δύναμις τοῦ Χριστοῦ. 
[10] διὸ εὐδοκῶ ἐν ἀσθενείαις, ἐν ὕβρεσιν, ἐν ἀνάγκαις, ἐν διωγμοῖς καὶ στενοχωρίαις, ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ: ὅταν γὰρ ἀσθενῶ, τότε δυνατός εἰμι.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 6:1‑13 ESV]

[1] [Jesus] went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. [2] And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? [3] Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him. [4] And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.” [5] And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. [6] And he marveled because of their unbelief.

And he went about among the villages teaching.

[7] And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. [8] He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—[9] but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. [10] And he said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there. [11] And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.” [12] So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. [13] And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.

## Collect

O God, Your almighty power is made known chiefly in showing mercy. Grant us the fullness of Your grace that we may be called to repentance and made partakers of Your heavenly treasures; through Your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
What is God doing in your life?
Now there is something to think about; there is something to share with others to encourage them to stay with Jesus.
You may often think of what God is doing in your life, but how often do you think of what *Satan* is doing in your life, and would you dare share that with others?
"This week, I was on YouTube while I was being paid to work, I called someone a fool ([Mt 5:22](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5:22/)), and I indulged in pornography."
There is a lot that Satan does in our lives of which we are ashamed before God---Lord have mercy!---and, frankly, that we hide from others so that more damage is not done by gossiping.
Nevertheless, there is something to share, no doubt, about what Satan is doing in your life, and I pray that you confessed it before God at the beginning of the service and keep His Absolution in the name of His Son Jesus near and dear to your heart.

What we have in our Epistle lesson today is St. Paul *boasting*, of all things, *boasting* of what Satan is doing in his life.

> **So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.**

Do not be mistaken, beloved in the Lord: St. Paul is not proud of his sin---he is ashamed of his sin and confesses it to God like we do.
But there is an issue with boasting in the Corinthian congregation.
2 Corinthians is written by St. Paul to the congregation in Corinth because there are issues with super-apostles coming in and drawing the congregation toward their teaching and their leadership.
The problem is that Paul does not know who they are and where they came from.
He planted the Corinthian congregation on his second missionary journey.[^1]
But about five years later after the congregation was founded, we find out about all the trouble going on at this new congregation.
Paul wrote First and Second Corinthians about five years after the congregation was founded.

[^1]: 49‑51 A.D.

There was 

* "I follow Paul. I follow Apollos. I follow Cephas. I follow Christ."---in other words, division in the church ([1Co 1:10‑17](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+1:10/)).
* Incest ([1Co 5:1‑2](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+5:1/)).
* Christians taking each other to court ([1Co 6:1‑8](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+6:1/)).
* Patronizing prostitutes ([1Co 6:16‑19](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+6:16/)).

Do you remember all the trouble the Corinthians got into? They could not stop.
There was

* Confusion about eating meat sacrificed to idols ([1Co 8:1‑11](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+8:1/)).
* People worshiping idols but then turning around and partaking in Holy Communion ([1Co 10:14‑17](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10:14/)).
* People stuffing their faces and getting drunk at Holy Communion ([1Co 11:20‑21](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+11:20/)).

And then there were the *super apostles*.
I do not know who these were, but they showed up at the Corinthian congregation while Paul was away and claimed to be great men of God.
And the Corinthian Christians listened to them.
Imagine St. Paul had planted Unity Lutheran Church and established our teaching and practice. We *know* that everything would be set on solid ground according to God's Word, for Paul is an expert in the Old Testament and an apostle personally called by Jesus Christ to preach the Gospel.
We know who St. Paul is and that he wrote thirteen of the books of the New Testament.

Now what if I come into the pulpit and say, "You know that Paul. He is a weak apostle. All he does is mumble about the Bible.
But a week ago today, while I was looking out on Lake Erie from the Edgewater pier, a cloud came up.
And it came right over me and there were angels singing and I was lifted up in the air so that the people at Edgewater looked like ants (and I could see Trevon's hoodie floating in the water).
And an angel called out to me and said, 'I am the angel Makrozilok. This city needs a revival because Lebron is going leaving town. Go to these people and preach the Word! Preach it and bring them to Jesus!'"
What an experience to boast about!
And who is Paul anyway?

This is the situation we find in our Epistle reading today.
Paul finds out about the super-apostles and now he has his say:


> **I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven---whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into paradise---whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows---and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.**

"Who is this guy? Maybe we should listen to him."

> **On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses---though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.**

"Don't regard me for what I say I saw. Regard me for what *you see me* say and do."

> **So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.**

Uncle Will has asked me, but I do no know what that thorn is. But this is how St. Paul boasts of what Satan is doing in his life.

> **Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this [thorn in the flesh], that it should leave me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”**

> **Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.**

Boast of your weaknesses and Christs strength.
That is Christian boasting.
Boast of your weaknesses but you may boast that Christ is bodily present in Holy Communion.

> **"Take, eat; this *is* my body, which is given for you. ... Drink of it, all of you; this cup *is* the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins."**

Now that is something to boast about. For St. Paul taught this to the congregation in Corinth.

> **The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.** ([1Co 10:16‑17](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10:16/) ESV)

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
