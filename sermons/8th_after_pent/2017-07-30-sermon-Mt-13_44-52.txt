## Old Testament [Dt 7:6‑9 ESV]

[6] “For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. [7] It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, [8] but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. [9] Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations.

## Epistle [Rm 8:28‑39 ESV]

[28] And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. [29] For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. [30] And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.

[31] What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? [32] He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? [33] Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. [34] Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. [35] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? [36] As it is written,

> “For your sake we are being killed all the day long;\
> we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”
	
	
[37] No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. [38] For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, [39] nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 13:44‑52 ESV; sermon text]

[44] “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

[45] “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, [46] who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.

[47] “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. [48] When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. [49] So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous [50] and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

[51] “Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.” [52] And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”

[44] Ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν θησαυρῷ κεκρυμμένῳ ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, ὃν εὑρὼν ἄνθρωπος ἔκρυψεν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς χαρᾶς αὐτοῦ ὑπάγει καὶ πωλεῖ πάντα ὅσα ἔχει καὶ ἀγοράζει τὸν ἀγρὸν ἐκεῖνον. 

[45] Πάλιν ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ ἐμπόρῳ ζητοῦντι καλοὺς μαργαρίτας: 
[46] εὑρὼν δὲ ἕνα πολύτιμον μαργαρίτην ἀπελθὼν πέπρακεν πάντα ὅσα εἶχεν καὶ ἠγόρασεν αὐτόν. 

[47] Πάλιν ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν σαγήνῃ βληθείσῃ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἐκ παντὸς γένους συναγαγούσῃ: 
[48] ἣν ὅτε ἐπληρώθη ἀναβιβάσαντες ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν καὶ καθίσαντες συνέλεξαν τὰ καλὰ εἰς ἄγγη, τὰ δὲ σαπρὰ ἔξω ἔβαλον. 
[49] οὕτως ἔσται ἐν τῇ συντελείᾳ τοῦ αἰῶνος: ἐξελεύσονται οἱ ἄγγελοι καὶ ἀφοριοῦσιν τοὺς πονηροὺς ἐκ μέσου τῶν δικαίων 
[50] καὶ βαλοῦσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν κάμινον τοῦ πυρός: ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων. 

[51] Συνήκατε ταῦτα πάντα; λέγουσιν αὐτῷ, Ναί. 
[52] ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Διὰ τοῦτο πᾶς γραμματεὺς μαθητευθεὶς τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν ὅμοιός ἐστιν ἀνθρώπῳ οἰκοδεσπότῃ ὅστις ἐκβάλλει ἐκ τοῦ θησαυροῦ αὐτοῦ καινὰ καὶ παλαιά.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, the confirmands learn this verse by heart: **"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,"** Luke 12:34.
Of all the things that occupy your attention, your *treasure* is where your heart is---it is your *treasure* with which your thoughts are occupied---it is your *treasure* that you really care about.
We will consider today what *your* treasure is, and then we will consider who *God's* treasure is.

In our Holy Gospel today, Jesus by way of parable teaches that we give up everything to have our treasure.

> **"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it."**

Beloved in the Lord, what is *your* treasure, that you would sell all you have and buy it?
It could be that your treasure is a winning Mega Millions ticket.
Sell all you have and buy the winning Mega Millions ticket.
Imagine that.
You now have *all the money you need*---everything---pay all your bills, pay bills for family members and friends, buy things---everything.
I am not bringing this up just for sake of example.
There are people---and you may be one of them---and if you are not one of them, I bet you know someone who is---there are people who spend a lot of time thinking about what they would do if they won the lottery.
Honestly, most times I have this conversation, the person would be happy just to pay his bills and have some extra to live on.
But to really set your heart on a winning Mega Millions ticket raises a red flag from the Bible: **You cannot serve God and money** [(Mt 6:24 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6/).

*[Illustration]* Remember Ananias and Sapphira.
They sold a piece of land with the intention of giving the money to the church.
They sold the land and brought only *a part* of the proceeds and laid them at the apostles' feet.
They were giving money to the church---good---but they did it not in a cheerful way but in a deceitful way---bad---they kept part of the money for themselves.
Apparently they lied about *how much* of the money they were giving to the church---they led the apostles to believe they were giving it all, but they gave only a part.
The apostle Peter saw through this deception and said,

> **“Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? ... You have not lied to man but to God.”** [(Ac 5:3‑4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+5/)

Ananias died on the spot, and so did his wife, Sapphira!
They dropped dead in a state of sin, and that is serious business.
To set your heart on money so that you serve it is dangerous to your salvation; **you cannot serve God and money**.
Help us, dear Lord Jesus, never to serve money but You alone!

Money may not be your only treasure: what would you do for *love*?
Love, may be in your mind a treasure greater than money.
Just to know that someone loves you, what would you do?
Love may be that treasure for which you would sell all you have and buy it.
A lack of love is a very deep and nagging ache.
I think it is fair to say that we all long to be loved.
But beware of that longing, for the devil is able to manipulate that longing with devastating effect.
Without going into embarrassing examples of what we do for love, let it suffice to say for now that marriage---marital love that God created for man and his wife before sin infected the Garden of Eden---marriage is disappearing, and the devil is behind it.

Yet if love is your treasure, beloved in the Lord, you have come to the right place.

> **For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.** [(Jn 3:16 KJV)](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-3/)

To receive the love you have always ached for, receive *God's* own love for you.
Receive *God's* love; He gives you His Son Jesus, and *Jesus saves you.*
Jesus saves you from the terrible consequences that overtake you when you for look for love in all the wrong places.
Jesus saves you from the horrible end that the rich man suffered in hell who did not show mercy to Lazarus but loved his luxurious lifestyle (Lk 16:19‑31).
_Jesus saves **you** from **your** sin,_ whether it be the love of money or the love of Satan's idea of love or the love of anything but God alone.
God, before the foundation of the world (Eph 1:4), chose you to be holy in Jesus knowing full well that you would rebel against Him and despise His Word.
You are the Prodigal Son and He is your Father who cares about nothing else than that you live, not die.
God so loved you that before the world was made He saw your trouble and chose His Son Jesus to save you from it.
As soon as the trouble came in the Garden of Eden, He promised that His Son, born of the virgin Mary, would crush Satan's head and get him off your back.
*[Point to the Crucifixion window.]*  Satan's head was crushed---his claim on you to drag you to hell---the devil's claim was rejected on Good Friday when Jesus fell as the devil's victim in your place.
*[Point to the Resurrection window]* But how can we not mention that Jesus appeared alive from the dead on the third day?
Jesus was not the devil's victim: the devil was *Jesus'* victim and Jesus has set you free from serving the devil.
Serve Jesus and love *Him*!
Jesus is your priceless treasure.

We sing it in our sermon hymn:

> Evil world, I leave thee;\
> Thou canst not deceive me,\
> Thine appeal is vain.\
> Sin that once did blind me,\
> Get thee far behind me,\
> Come not forth again.

> Jesus, priceless Treasure,\
> Fount of purest pleasure,\
> Truest Friend to me.

And so, we confess that Jesus is our greatest treasure for which we gladly sell everything we have and buy the field.
Jesus is our pearl of great value, for which we sell all we have and buy it.

Yet our Old Testament reading and even our Epistle reading turn it around.

> **It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.** [(Dt 7:7‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+7/)

**"It is because the LORD loves you"**---now who is the treasure? You are---*you* being the Israelites that the LORD loves.
But at this point, beloved in the Lord, I invite you to take Old Testament Israel as Christ's Church and Pharaoh as the devil.
God's own love for *you* moved Him to rescue you from the devil---to redeem you from your worst trouble and bring you safely home.
*[Point to the baptismal font.]* He brought you through the Red Sea when He baptized you, drowning the demons who seek to wrestle you away from heaven.

> **He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all** [(Rm 8:32 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+8/)

Now who is the treasure for whom God gave up His own Son? You are.
You are that treasure, and you are loved very much indeed.
AMEN.
