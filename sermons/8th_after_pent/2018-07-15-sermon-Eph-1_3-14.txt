## Old Testament [Am 7:7‑15 ESV]

[7] This is what he showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. [8] And the LORD said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said,

> “Behold, I am setting a plumb line\
> in the midst of my people Israel;\
> I will never again pass by them;\
> [9] the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate,\
> and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste,\
> and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”

[10] Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words. [11] For thus Amos has said,

> “‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword,\
> and Israel must go into exile\
> away from his land.’”

[12] And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there, [13] but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.”

[14] Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, "I was no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs. [15] But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’"

## Epistle [Eph 1:3‑14 ESV; sermon text]

[3] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, [4] even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love
[5] he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, [6] to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. [7] In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, [8] which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight [9] making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ [10] as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.

[11] In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, [12] so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. [13] In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, [14] who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.

[3] Εὐλογητὸς ὁ θεὸς καὶ πατὴρ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὁ εὐλογήσας ἡμᾶς ἐν πάσῃ εὐλογίᾳ πνευματικῇ ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις ἐν Χριστῷ, 
[4] καθὼς ἐξελέξατο ἡμᾶς ἐν αὐτῷ πρὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου, εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀγάπῃ, 
[5] προορίσας ἡμᾶς εἰς υἱοθεσίαν διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ εἰς αὐτόν, κατὰ τὴν εὐδοκίαν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ, 
[6] εἰς ἔπαινον δόξης τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ ἧς ἐχαρίτωσεν ἡμᾶς ἐν τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ, 
[7] ἐν ᾧ ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν διὰ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ, τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν παραπτωμάτων, κατὰ τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ, 
[8] ἧς ἐπερίσσευσεν εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ φρονήσει 
[9] γνωρίσας ἡμῖν τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ, κατὰ τὴν εὐδοκίαν αὐτοῦ ἣν προέθετο ἐν αὐτῷ 
[10] εἰς οἰκονομίαν τοῦ πληρώματος τῶν καιρῶν, ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι τὰ πάντα ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ, τὰ ἐπὶ τοῖς οὐρανοῖς καὶ τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς: ἐν αὐτῷ, 

[11] ἐν ᾧ καὶ ἐκληρώθημεν προορισθέντες κατὰ πρόθεσιν τοῦ τὰ πάντα ἐνεργοῦντος κατὰ τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ, 
[12] εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς εἰς ἔπαινον δόξης αὐτοῦ τοὺς προηλπικότας ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ: 
[13] ἐν ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀκούσαντες τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας, τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς σωτηρίας ὑμῶν, ἐν ᾧ καὶ πιστεύσαντες ἐσφραγίσθητε τῷ πνεύματι τῆς ἐπαγγελίας τῷ ἁγίῳ, 
[14] ὅ ἐστιν ἀρραβὼν τῆς κληρονομίας ἡμῶν, εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν τῆς περιποιήσεως, εἰς ἔπαινον τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 6:14‑29 ESV]

[14] King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.” [15] But others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” [16] But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.” [17] For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. [18] For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.” [19] And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, [20] for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.

[21] But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. [22] For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.” [23] And he vowed to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.” [24] And she went out and said to her mother, “For what should I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.” [25] And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” [26] And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. [27] And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison [28] and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. [29] When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

## Collect

O Lord, You granted Your prophets strength to resist the temptations of the devil and courage to proclaim repentance.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Most of you are aware that I am working on my garage this summer.
I am not proud to tell you that my garage is dilapidated by my own fault: I should have repaired or replaced it years ago, but I did not.
Furthermore, I am not proud to tell you that I am working on it *this* summer because I was cited by the city of Cleveland and told to do something about it.
My garage has deteriorated to the point that the whole thing needs to be torn down.
I am working on it, and yesterday, Trevon, Nikki, Laura, and Kat all worked on it together with me---thank you for your hard work!

Here is how it came to where it is today.
Years ago, I took the shingles off and I saw that the sill plate, which is the lowest part of the wooden structure of the garage---the decay-resistant wood that sits flat on the concrete to which the bottom of the garage walls' studs are attached---this sill plate was decayed.
All of the weight of the garage rests on the sill plate, and it needed to be replaced.
Instead of putting the shingles back on, I put a tarp on the roof with the idea of getting the garage structurally sound before I climbed back up on the roof and dropped shingle packages up there.
The idea was to jack up one side of the garage one after another, replace the sill plate, jack up the next side of the garage, replace the sill plate, all the way around, and *then* shingle the roof.
For years and years I never replaced the sill plate, the tarp got torn and let in the rain, and now the whole garage has to come down.

In our Old Testament reading, Amos prophesies,

> **"Behold, I am setting a plumb line**\
> **in the midst of my people Israel;**\
> **I will never again pass by them."**\

God is a building inspector with a plumb line.
A plumb line, for those of you who do not know, is just a string with a weight on the end.
You could make your own plumb line simply by tying a nut, a metal fastener, to one end of a string.
Hold the other end of the string up high and let the heavy end hang there.
What is a plumb line good for?
To check if a wall is vertical or if it is crooked.
Just hang the plumb line from the top of a wall with the heavy end hanging free in the air, steady the heavy end to keep it from swinging, and the string is vertical---perfectly straight up and down.
Now compare the string to the wall.
The plumb line should be hanging about an inch from the edge of a wall.
If the weight hangs freely and the wall is one inch from the string from top to bottom, then the wall is *plumb*: it is perfectly vertical from top to bottom; that is why you call it a *plumb line*.
If the hanging end touches the wall of or if the hanging end gets further and further away from the wall, the wall is *out of plumb* and you have to wonder if the wall can be repaired or if it is in danger of collapsing.
(You do not want a wall to collapse and you do not want to be in a building when a wall collapses!)

If you hang a plumb line from my garage wall, it might be one inch out from the top, but maybe four inches out from the bottom.
My garage wall is crooked.
It either needs to be repaired or it needs to be torn down.
It has gotten out of hand and it needs to be torn down!

When God checked the Old Testament Israelites with His plumb line, He found that they were crooked.
He had passed by the wall before and found that it was *beginning* to be crooked, but He waited to see if the Israelites would make the repairs---repent of their sins---and fix the wall.
But the wall was never fixed and by the time He sends the prophet Amos to them, the wall is out of hand and the whole building needs to be torn down.

On that note, what is that God foresaw at the foundation of the world?
We turn now to our Epistle reading from Ephesians, chapter 1:

> **Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.**

When God laid the foundation of the world, were we to be holy and blameless and that is it?
You know what happened: Adam sinned and through Adam, sin spread to us all ([Rm 5:12](https://www.esv.org/Romans+5:12/)).
God made a perfect foundation in the Garden of Eden and man built on it with sin.
Man built walls with sin.
Did one generation repair the walls so that God could measure with His plumb line and see that it was better?
Look at the world yourself and see what sin has built.
Sin has built huge walls, mighty walls with greed and lust.
Any wall built with sin is going to be out of plumb and it is only going to get worse---it will collapse.

What God foresaw before the foundation of the world was the collapse of the wall that sin built.
What God foresaw and decided to do before the foundation of the world was to let the wall collapse---let it collapse on Jesus and crush Him before it crushes us.
Behold our Lord's body dead on the Cross: though He is crushed by our sin, not one bone is broken ([Jn 19:36](https://www.esv.org/John+19:36/)).
Though He is crushed by the burden of our sin, He is not broken: He has become the cornerstone.

> **The stone that the builders rejected**\
> **has become the cornerstone.** ([Ps 118:22](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+118:22/) ESV)

Sinful builders, including you and I, built a wall but rejected Jesus.
That did not keep Him from going to the Cross to save us before the wall collapsed on us.

He now is the cornerstone of His Church---the building built with now sin where by faith in Jesus, we are truly holy and without blemish before God.
The Holy Spirit reminds us that this is most certainly true:
we are holy and blamesless before God, washed by the blood of Jesus.
**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

## Notes

Am 7:7‑8. When the LORD builds the house, he builds it right, using a plumb line. He has come to check His house---to see if it is still built right or if it is in need of repair. **"I will never again pass by them."**--"I will not pass by their sin. I will punish it."

Am 7:10. Jeroboam had built false altars at Bethel and Dan ([1Ki 12:29](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+12:29/)).

Eph 1:4. *ἀμώμους* literally means *without blemish*.

The prophet Amos, in particular was from the southern kingdom of Judah; in Judah, he was a shepherd and a dresser of sycamore figs ([Am 7:14](https://www.esv.org/Amos+7:14/)).
