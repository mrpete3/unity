## Old Testament [Is 55:1‑5 ESV]

> [1] “Come, everyone who thirsts,\
> come to the waters;\
> and he who has no money,\
> come, buy and eat!\
> Come, buy wine and milk\
> without money and without price.\
> [2] Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,\
> and your labor for that which does not satisfy?\
> Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good,\
> and delight yourselves in rich food.\
> [3] Incline your ear, and come to me;\
> hear, that your soul may live;\
> and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,\
> my steadfast, sure love for David.\
> [4] Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples,\
> a leader and commander for the peoples.\
> [5] Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know,\
> and a nation that did not know you shall run to you,\
> because of the LORD your God, and of the Holy One of Israel,\
> for he has glorified you.

## Epistle [Rm 9:1‑13 ESV]

[1] I am speaking the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit—[2] that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. [3] For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh. [4] They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises. [5] To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.

[6] But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, [7] and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [8] This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring. [9] For this is what the promise said: “About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.” [10] And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, [11] though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls—[12] she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” [13] As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”

## Holy Gospel [Mt 14:13‑21 ESV; sermon text]

[13] Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. [14] When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. [15] Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” [16] But Jesus said, “They need not go away; you give them something to eat.” [17] They said to him, “We have only five loaves here and two fish.” [18] And he said, “Bring them here to me.” [19] Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. [20] And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. [21] And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

[18] ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, Φέρετέ μοι ὧδε αὐτούς. 
[19] καὶ κελεύσας τοὺς ὄχλους ἀνακλιθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῦ χόρτου, λαβὼν τοὺς πέντε ἄρτους καὶ τοὺς δύο ἰχθύας, ἀναβλέψας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν εὐλόγησεν καὶ κλάσας ἔδωκεν τοῖς μαθηταῖς τοὺς ἄρτους οἱ δὲ μαθηταὶ τοῖς ὄχλοις. 
[20] καὶ ἔφαγον πάντες καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν, καὶ ἦραν τὸ περισσεῦον τῶν κλασμάτων δώδεκα κοφίνους πλήρεις.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, let us turn today to one of the main events recorded in the Bible: the Exodus.
*Exodus* means *emigration*.
If you have been paying attention to the news, there is an *exodus* today of people escaping the war in Syria.
They are leaving Syria and looking for a new home in a new country where they can live in peace.

Around 1,446 B.C. there was the Exodus of Hebrew slaves from Egypt.
God, as you know, called Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, through the wilderness for 40 years, and finally to the Promised Land of Canaan---the land God had promised to Abraham and his descendants.
The Exodus is not a blip in the history of God's chosen people, the Jews: the Exodus defines who they are.
Sadly, there is much to learn about our sin in the Exodus.
The Exodus defines who God is.
Gladly, there is much to learn about our redemption from sin in the Exodus as well.

The Exodus is a picture of our life in Christ.
Take our slavery to sin as slavery in Egypt; that makes Pharaoh the devil, the hard taskmaster whose heart is hardened toward God.
Take Jesus as Moses, who saves us from Pharaoh's slavery.
Take Holy Communion as the Passover.
Take Baptism as crossing through the water of the Red Sea.
Take our struggles in this life as wandering through the wilderness for 40 years.
Take the Promised Land as heaven.
And, beloved in the Lord, take the blood of Jesus as the blood of bulls and sheep sacrificed to satisfy God's anger against our sins.
**Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins** [(Heb 9:22b ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+9/): we learn this from the Exodus.
Do you see the picture?
The Exodus is a picture of Christ and His Church.

There were 600,000 men, plus women and children, who were in the Exodus from Egypt (Ex 12:37)---let us say 1½ million people altogether to be fed in the wilderness for 40 years---*1½ million*---more people than were at the Cavs' victory parade.
It is hot and dry in the wilderness, and very little grows in the desert: What are the people to eat? What are the people to drink?
Beloved in the Lord, feeding 1½ million people in the wilderness and giving them water to drink for 40 years is not a difficult thing for the Lord!
We learn this from the Exodus.
Moses struck a rock with his staff and water gushed out of it (Ex 17:1‑7); there was enough for everyone to drink.
And, of course, God gave everyone bread from heaven, manna, to eat.

> **The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.”** [(Ex 16:4‑5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+16/)

Manna appeared on the ground around the camp of the Israelites every morning from Sunday to Friday; on Friday morning, there was twice as much, for God had told them to rest on Saturday, the Sabbath.
The people had grumbled about not having as much to eat in the wilderness as they had in Egypt, so God gave them manna to eat.
The people grumbled about not having enough meat to eat and God gave them quail to eat as well (Ex 16:13)---again, enough to feed 1½ million people.
This is not a difficult thing for the Lord.

But trouble already boiled on that first Saturday after the manna appeared.
What did the people do?
Some went out to gather manna even though God plainly told them to rest on the Sabbath (Ex 16:27‑28);
some disregared God's plain Word and went out to gather manna anyway as if they knew better than God's Commandment: **Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.**
After God had given them bread from heaven for six straight days, even double on the sixth, they still did not trust God to properly feed them, and they went out looking for manna on the seventh day, the day of rest.

No matter how faithful God was to provide for the Israelites in the wilderness, they continued to grumble---they continued to second-guess God.
This was a sin for which God's anger burned hot.
The situation became deadly serious in Numbers, chapter 11.
The people complained.
Again, they complained about not eating as much meat at they would like.

> **“Oh that we had meat to eat! We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this _manna_ to look at.”** [(Nm 11:4‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+11/)

They were sick and tired of the manna with which God graciously fed them from heaven day in and day out; they craved meat and grumbled against the manna.

> **Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And _the anger of the LORD_ blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased. Moses said to the LORD, “Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child,’ to the land that you swore to give their fathers? Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me. If you will treat me like this, _kill me at once_, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.”** [(Nm 11:10‑15 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+11/)

As you just heard, this is the point where Moses could not take it anymore; this is the point the burden of leading these complainers was too much for him: he would rather die than lead the Israelites.
But it is at this point that God gave Moses the 70 elders to lighten his load of handling the people's complaints.
Nevertheless, right after the elders had been appointed, God's anger burned fiercely against the Israelites, who instead of thanking God for His continual blessing continued to grumble against Him and against His chosen leader Moses.
At that time, God gave them meat alritght. God poured out quail---more than they could eat---and as the Israelites satisfied their craving for meat, God put many of them to _death_---the Bible says it was **"a very great plague"** (Nm 11:31‑33).

Be warned: *cast off what you crave when the Lord has given you what you need*.
The devil may remind you of some pleasure---he may remind you of the meat in Egypt---something you enjoyed when you were a slave to the devil that seems better than what you have now as a servant of Jesus.
Pray for wisdom that you would properly value what God has freely given you when you were baptized into Jesus, namely the forgiveness of sins and the Holy Spirit, and shun the craving of your flesh.
*[Illustration]* For example, if you were once deceitful and covetous businessman but now you are a humble Christian civil servant, do not complain, craving what you had when you loved money: you are far better off now loving Jesus, and let that be it!
Be grateful that you now love Jesus and appear to the world as your Lord Jesus did, who **came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many** [(Mt 20:28 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+20/).
Beloved in the Lord, let that be enough. No, let that be *everything*---it is everything to have Jesus and to serve Him in His kingdom in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness.

My next example is no example at all---it is *reality* for each and every one of you.
*You are forgiven by faith in the blood of Jesus!*
Let the reality of your forgiveness fill you with the Holy Spirit and renew your mind daily.
You learned from the Exodus that the shed blood of a subsitutionary sacrifice atones for sin.
You are the sinner; *[Point to Crucifixion window.]* Christ is your subsitute whose blood was shed on the altar of the Cross.
The Father has accepted His beloved Son's bloody sacrifice to atone for your sins: your heavenly Father is no longer angry with you but has received you into His favor by the merit of His Son Jesus.
There is nothing left for you to do but love Him for the work He did---His innocent suffering and death---to bring you into God's good favor.
*[Illustration]* The sinful woman at the end of Luke, chapter 7 fully realized this---not for the work Jesus did, but for the work He was about to do.
Out of gratefulness for being forgiven her sins she wept and kissed Jesus' feet and anointed them with ointment.
She could care less about what anyone thought of her: she had been forgiven much and now she loved Jesus very much. Period.
This, beloved in the Lord is your reality as much as it was for the sinful woman!
Jesus' forgiveness is your reality *in which you live day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute*: forgiven!
He has brought you out of Satan's slavery and at this moment you are traveling through the wilderness.
By virtue of having been forgiven your sins by faith in Jesus, what have you to complain about?
There is no mention of the sinful woman in Luke 7 ever complaining---the point is that she was filled with gratitude.
Call the sinful woman's love *the attitude of gratitude*.
Beloved in the Lord, whatever grumbling may arise in you against God is suppressed by the reality that *you are forgiven by faith in the blood of Jesus*. Thank you, Jesus!

Now that you are forgiven, what are you to eat? What are you to drink? If Jesus has done this great thing for you, is it not a small thing that He also clothe and feed you, O you, of little faith?
In our Holy Gospel, Jesus is faced with 5,000 mouths to feed and the disciples are worried;
Jesus is not.
The disciples tell Jesus,

> **“This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”**

> **But Jesus said, “They need not go away; _you_ give them something to eat.”**

Beloved in the Lord, that is your position as well as a disciple of Jesus.
There is not enough food for everyone to eat.
By faith in Christ's Word, *you* give them something to eat.
By serving Christ, you will find that where others may have reason to grumble you have been called to serve and provide what Christ wants to give.
Rejoice in your forgiveness and do what Christ your Lord tells you to do.

> **Then [Jesus] ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. And they all ate and were satisfied.**

See the parallel to Moses feeding the Israelites in the wilderness.
The Israelites were following Jesus in the wilderness to the Promised Land;
you are following Jesus through your earthly life to your heavenly homeland.
As you follow Him---as you struggle---as you bear your Cross and follow Him---as you put your hand to the plow and not look back---He feeds you, He feeds others though you, and there is plenty left over after everyone has eaten.
Behold, this is your life forgiven in Christ.
AMEN.

## Notes

It is routine for God to feed us miraculously.

Is 55:2. It would be good to repeat this saying.

Rm 9:11. **Not because of works but because of Him who calls**

Mt 16:9‑10. Jesus rebukes the disciples for not remembering the feeding of the 5,000 and the 4,000. He had told them, **"Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees,"** and the disciples had thought the issue was that they had no bread.
