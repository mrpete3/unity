## Old Testament [Jer 23:1‑6 ESV]

[1] “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. [2] Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD. [3] Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. [4] I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.

[5] "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. [6] In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The LORD is our righteousness.’"

## Epistle [Eph 2:11‑22 ESV; sermon text]

[11] Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands—[12] remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[13] But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[14] For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
[15] by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, [16] and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
[17] And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. [18] For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. [19] So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, [20] built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, [21] in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. [22] In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

[11] Διὸ μνημονεύετε ὅτι ποτὲ ὑμεῖς τὰ ἔθνη ἐν σαρκί, οἱ λεγόμενοι ἀκροβυστία ὑπὸ τῆς λεγομένης περιτομῆς ἐν σαρκὶ χειροποιήτου, 
[12] ὅτι ἦτε τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ χωρὶς Χριστοῦ, ἀπηλλοτριωμένοι τῆς πολιτείας τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ξένοι τῶν διαθηκῶν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἐλπίδα μὴ ἔχοντες καὶ ἄθεοι ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ. 
[13] νυνὶ δὲ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ὑμεῖς οἵ ποτε ὄντες μακρὰν ἐγενήθητε ἐγγὺς ἐν τῷ αἵματι τοῦ Χριστοῦ. 
[14] Αὐτὸς γάρ ἐστιν ἡ εἰρήνη ἡμῶν, ὁ ποιήσας τὰ ἀμφότερα ἓν καὶ τὸ μεσότοιχον τοῦ φραγμοῦ λύσας, τὴν ἔχθραν, ἐν τῇ σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ, 
[15] τὸν νόμον τῶν ἐντολῶν ἐν δόγμασιν καταργήσας, ἵνα τοὺς δύο κτίσῃ ἐν αὐτῷ εἰς ἕνα καινὸν ἄνθρωπον ποιῶν εἰρήνην, 
[16] καὶ ἀποκαταλλάξῃ τοὺς ἀμφοτέρους ἐν ἑνὶ σώματι τῷ θεῷ διὰ τοῦ σταυροῦ, ἀποκτείνας τὴν ἔχθραν ἐν αὐτῷ. 
[17] καὶ ἐλθὼν εὐηγγελίσατο εἰρήνην ὑμῖν τοῖς μακρὰν καὶ εἰρήνην τοῖς ἐγγύς: 
[18] ὅτι δι' αὐτοῦ ἔχομεν τὴν προσαγωγὴν οἱ ἀμφότεροι ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα. 
[19] ἄρα οὖν οὐκέτι ἐστὲ ξένοι καὶ πάροικοι, ἀλλὰ ἐστὲ συμπολῖται τῶν ἁγίων καὶ οἰκεῖοι τοῦ θεοῦ, 
[20] ἐποικοδομηθέντες ἐπὶ τῷ θεμελίῳ τῶν ἀποστόλων καὶ προφητῶν, ὄντος ἀκρογωνιαίου αὐτοῦ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, 
[21] ἐν ᾧ πᾶσα οἰκοδομὴ συναρμολογουμένη αὔξει εἰς ναὸν ἅγιον ἐν κυρίῳ, 
[22] ἐν ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς συνοικοδομεῖσθε εἰς κατοικητήριον τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν πνεύματι.

## Holy Gospel [Mk 6:30‑44 ESV]

[30] The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. [31] And he said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. [32] And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. [33] Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. [34] When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. [35] And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. [36] Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” [37] But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?” [38] And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” [39] Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. [40] So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. [41] And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. [42] And they all ate and were satisfied. [43] And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. [44] And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.

## Introit [Ps 147:7-11; antiphon: Ps 145:16]

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Our Epistle readings for last Sunday, this Sunday, and the next six Sundays are from St. Paul's letter to the church in Ephesus.
Let us spend some time on Ephesus.
If you would locate Ephesus today, it would be in ... _[Wait for people to think about it.]_ ... Turkey on the coast of the Aegean Sea.
In the Bible days, this part of Turkey was called *Asia*; yes, the whole continent is named after a section of Turkey.
The Gospel was first proclaimed in Ephesus on St. Paul's second missionary journey from 49‑51 A.D.

> **And they came to Ephesus, and [Paul] left [Priscilla and Aquila] there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined. But on taking leave of them he said, “I will return to you if God wills,” and he set sail from Ephesus.** ([Ac 18:19‑21](https://www.esv.org/Acts+18:19/) ESV)

It seems like a Christian congregation was not quite planted in Ephesus on the second missionary visit, but Paul definitely reasoned with the Jews in the synagogue and they wanted Paul to stay longer.

Between Paul's second and third missionary journeys, the Bible tells us that Apollos appeared in Ephesus and picked up where Paul left off.

> **Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.** ([Ac 18:24‑28](https://www.esv.org/Acts+18/) ESV)

Apollos, a native of Alexandria---_[Solicit answers.]_ who can tell me where Alexandria is? Egypt.
Alexandria was a major Greek-speaking city with a world-famous library, founded in 283 B.C.; it has been said that the library in Alexandria was the ancient world's single greatest archive of knowledge.
This library came to an end in 640 A.D. under the rule of Muslim Caliph Omar.[^1]
Alexandria is also home of the Greek Bible.
The Bible widely used by Greek-speaking Jews and by the apostles was the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament.
This famous Greek Bible is called the *Septuagint* because it is claimed to have been translated by 70 scholars---*Septuagint* literally means *seventy* in Latin.
The story goes that Jewish scholars asked the king Ptolemy for permission to translate the Hebrew Torah into Greek for inclusion in, of all places, the Library of Alexandria.[^2]

[^2]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint), accessed 22 July 2018.

This all happened around 200 B.C.---250 or so years before Apollos came to Ephesus---but when the Bible tells us that Apollos was from Alexandria, this tells us that he was likely very well educated in the Septuagint; Apollos knew his Bible.
Soon, Alexandria would become a leading Christian city, for when the bishops would convene a council to decide issues of Christian doctrine and practice, the bishop of Alexandria was included.[^3]

[^3]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_of_Alexandria), accessed 22 July 2018.

Apollos of Alexandria came to Ephesus to teach in the Jewish synagogue between St. Paul's second and third missionary journeys.

St. Paul turned around after his second missionary journey and returned to Ephesus on his third missionary journey from 52‑55 A.D., and it is then that the Ephesian congregation was founded, for Paul stayed in Ephesus for *three years* on his third missionary journey.

There are both Jews and Gentile in the Ephesian congregation.
There is *hostility* between Jew and Gentile in the Ephesian congregation.

> **Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called _“the uncircumcision”_ by what is called the _circumcision_, which is made in the flesh by hands—remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, _having no hope and without God in the world_.**

> **But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.**

> **For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility**

What is the wall of hostility between Jew and Gentile?

> **by abolishing _the law of commandments_ expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.**

Jews are different from Gentiles because of the Law of the Commandments.
Jews lives by these Commandments and Gentiles do not.
But Christians are not saved by keeping the Commandments, though we know that it is good to keep them.
The Commandments condemn us, but our Lord Jesus blood on the Cross atones for our sin, whether we are Jew or Gentile.

The Ephesians repented and clung to Jesus and expressed their faith in love;
surely love between Gentile and Jewish Christians ... but only for a while.
Letter to the Ephesian church in Revelation:

> **But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.** ([Rv 2:4‑5 ESV](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+2:4/))

May our faith endure as well as our love for each other.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

## Notes

I apologize for not being clear last week with my illustration of God being a building inspector with a plumb line.
The prophet Amos describes God has having a plumb line and measuring His people ([Am 7:7‑8](https://www.esv.org/Amos+7:7/)).
A plumb line hangs straight up and down every time; to check if a wall is straight up and down hold a plumb line next to it and compare: if the wall follows the plumb line, then the wall is perfectly straight up and down.
But we have built crooked walls with sin that have failed God's inspection.

Take for example the Tower of Babel.
