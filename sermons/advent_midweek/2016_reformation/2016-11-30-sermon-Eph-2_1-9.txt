## First reading [Ezk 34:11‑16 ESV]

[11] “For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out. [12] As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. [13] And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country. [14] I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel. [15] I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD. [16] I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.

## Epistle [Eph 2:1‑9 ESV; sermon text]

[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—[3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—[6] and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 9:1‑7 ESV]

[1] As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. [2] And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” [3] Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him. [4] We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. [5] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” [6] Having said these things, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud [7] and said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord,

> **When we were dead in our trespasses, [God] made us alive together with Christ&mdash;by _grace_ you have been saved.**

I believe you have heard this passage before, especially this expression: **by _grace_ you have been saved**.
It is plain and simple: **by grace you have been saved**.

Perhaps the best-known Christian hymn in the English language says,

> *Amazing grace&mdash;how sweet the sound&mdash;*\
> *That saved a wretch like me!*

We hear the word _grace_ so many times and in so many ways&mdash;_Grace_ is even a woman's name&mdash;what does _the Bible_ say about _grace_?
It says a lot of things, and I will cover only two aspects of grace tonight.

1. Grace makes the dead live.
1. Grace keeps sheep safe.

You heard in the Epistle reading tonight the unflattering truth about you and me: We were dead in trespasses and sins.
_Dead out of the gate. Dead on arrival._
There is nothing we could do: we were dead already.
We were dead in trespasses and sins.
The trespasses and sins in which we were born (Ps 51:5; Rm 5:12)&mdash;the trespasses and sins in which we walked&mdash;proved that we followed Satan, **following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.**
We were alive to Satan and dead to God: unable on our own to fear and love God; unable on our own to properly pray to Him; unable on our own to properly expect help from Him; unable on our own to give thanks to God and praise Him;
unable on our own to obey Him in times of suffering; unable on our own to love our neighbor _because we were spiritually dead_ (Ap V (III) 4/125).
When St Paul writes, **You were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked,** you were spiritually dead. _Dead out of the gate. Dead on arrival._

But grace makes the dead live.
Grace is action performed by God on the spiritually dead.
The particular action is the proclamation of His Word: God's Word never returns empty and always accomplished the purpose for which it is sent (Is 55:11).
His Word may be the oral preaching of the Gospel; His Word may be combined with water to make Baptism; His Word may be your pastor pronouncing Christ's own absolution to you; His Word may be combined with bread and wine to make Holy Communion.
God's Word is the means by which He performs resurrection on the spiritually dead.
Grace is action done by God when we are completely unable to help ourselves.
Seeing this angle on grace, you can read verses in the Bible like Romans 5:8&mdash;**while we were still sinners, Christ died for us**&mdash;we can read that and *we recognize that this is grace*!
Christ died for us while we were helpless sinners---unable to even lift a finger to do anything for the forgiveness of our sins.
This is God doing for us what we are unable to do for ourselves.
That is the first teaching on grace: Grace makes the dead live.

The second teaching on grace, which we heard in the Old Testament reading, is that grace keeps sheep safe.
And you are well aware that it is not only in Ezekiel, chapter 34 that the Bible talks about Jesus, the Good Shepherd, and we are his sheep.
You hear it in Psalm 23 and you hear it in John, chapter 10, among other places in the Bible (Nm 27:17; Ps 79:13; Is 53:6).
Now sheep are not dead---they move around and make noise---but they still teach us grace,
for without a shepherd, sheep get in trouble---big trouble.
Left to themselves in the wilderness, sheep are vulnerable to the wolf, who is a picture of Satan.
It is Satan that Jesus refers to when He says, **&ldquo;He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep&rdquo;** [(Jn&nbsp;10:12&#x2011;15 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/John%2010%3A12-15/)
Take that as the second teaching on grace: Grace keeps sheep safe.

In conclusion, the state of sin, in which we are born, leaves us so helpless that we can only be saved from sin, death, and Satan by _outside help_.
Our outside helper is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
The Father had compassion on His lost sheep and did not want to lose us to Satan.
He sent His Son to be our Good Shepherd to lay down His life to keep us safe in the forgiveness of our sins.
He sent preachers out into the world to tell us of His Son, and by this preaching, the Holy Spirit brought us from spiritual death so life, so that we now love God who has had mercy on us and made us alive.
AMEN.
