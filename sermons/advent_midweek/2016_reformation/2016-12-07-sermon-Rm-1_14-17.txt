## First reading [Gn 15:1‑6 ESV]


[1] After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” [2] But Abram said, “O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” [3] And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.” [4] And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.” [5] And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” [6] And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

## Epistle [Rm 1:14‑17 ESV; sermon text]
[14] I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. [15] So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. [16] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. [17] For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”

## Holy Gospel [Lk 7:1‑10 ESV]

[1] After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. [2] Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him. [3] When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. [4] And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy to have you do this for him, [5] for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue.” [6] And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. [7] Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. [8] For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” [9] When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.” [10] And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, last week I preached about grace.
The main message of the Bible *is* God's grace.
He forgave us our sins in Jesus when we were helpless to save ourselves.
Grace saves a sinner who is dead in his sins---dead and unable to do any good before God.
Grace also takes care of lost sheep---unable to find the right way on my own.
Grace means God does everything for me, and I can only receive it with thanksgiving.
The other message of the Bible, however, not emphasized like grace, but without which we cannot receive God's grace---the other message of the Bible is God's *Law*---that He punishes those who transgss against His Law.

As a refresher about the Law and how serious it is to break God's Law, or transgress against it,
let us review only the last two Commandments, as numbered in the Small Catechism.
They are: (9th&nbsp;Commandment) **&ldquo;You shall not _covet_ your neighbor's house&rdquo;**, and
(10th&nbsp;Commandment) **&ldquo;You shall not _covet_ your neighbor's wife, &hellip;&rdquo;**
To *covet* is not to steal---to *covet* is not to commit adultery or to defraud---to *covet* is only to *think* about doing these things---to covet is to want to take what God has given to your neighbor for yourself.
And, unfortunately, that is *very* easy to do---too easy.
Yet it is still a sin punishable by death according to God's holy Law.

Martin Luther, by the way, was probably tormented by coveting, for he had thought that by becoming a monk he would be able to be purified of his sins with which he was afflicted while studying law in the early 1500's at the University of Erfurt in Germany.
Once a monk, Luther prayed seven times a day, he whipped his body, he deprived himself of sleep, but his evil thoughts and desires---like coveting---his evil thoughts and desires would not go away.
Luther, even as a monk, confessed that he was a sinner with evil thoughts and desires, and, worst of all, he *found not comfort* because he was looking to the Law.

&ldquo;The Law is God's Commandments, which I have broken.&rdquo;

> [And] **the commandments, &ldquo;You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,&rdquo; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;** [(Rm 13:9 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+13:9/)

&ldquo;Even when I have done good deeds and kept the Commandments partially, I still have *not* been purified of my sinful thoughts,&rdquo; complained Luther.
*&ldquo;Where can I find comfort for my soul?&rdquo;*
Martin Luther's superior in the Augustinian order of monks, Father Staupitz, thought his young monk would find the comfort he was longing for by studying and teaching theology.

And Luther found it. *[Show painting of Luther's discovery]*

> **For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, &ldquo;The righteous shall live by faith.&rdquo;**

These verses made Martin Luther a Christian.
He gave up on his good works and let Jesus help him. AMEN.
