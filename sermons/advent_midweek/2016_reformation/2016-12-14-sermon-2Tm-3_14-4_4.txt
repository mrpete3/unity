## First reading [Ezk 2:9‑3:10, 19 ESV]

[2:9] And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. [10] And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.

[3:1] And he said to me, “Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” [2] So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat. [3] And he said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.” Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.

[4] And he said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them. [5] For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel—[6] not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. [7] But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. [8] Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. [9] Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.” [10] Moreover, he said to me, “Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.

## Epistle [2Tm 3:14‑4:4 ESV; sermon text]

[3:14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it [15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. [16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, [17] that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

[1] I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: [2] preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. [3] For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, [4] and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 16:19‑31 ESV]

[19] “There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. [20] And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, [21] who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. [22] The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, [23] and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. [24] And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ [25] But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. [26] And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’
[27] And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house—[28] for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ [29] But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ [30] And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ [31] He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, two weeks ago I preached about grace; last week I preached about faith.
You may know what is coming: Scripture. *Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone.*
For during the Reformation, these were put together to make a slogan: *Sola Gratia. Sola Fide. Sola Scriptura.---Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone.*
The third emphasis of the Reformation, *Scripture Alone*, is our topic this evening.

To realize how serious *Scripture Alone* is, you need look no further than Christ being tempted by Satan in the wilderness.
When our Lord was hungry, the tempter said to Him, **"If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."**
But our Lord answered, **"_It is written_, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God'"** (Mt 4:3-4 ESV).
Christ had but one weapon against Satan: it was His own Word.

And to take another example of how serious *Scripture Alone* is, look to tonight's Holy Gospel.
The rich man died after having shown no mercy to Lazarus---the rich man was in torment in hell and he *saw* Lazarus in heaven in Abraham's bosom and
begged Abraham, **"[27] I beg you, father, to send [Lazarus] to my father's house---[28] for I have five brothers---so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment."**
[29] But Abraham said, **"_They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them._"** [30] And [the rich man] said, **"No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent."**
[31] Abraham said to him, **"If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead"** (Lk 16:27-31).

AMEN.

## Notes

A sinner is justified by grace alone (*sola gratia*) through faith alone (*sola fide*) for the sake of Christ alone (*solus Christus*), a truth revealed to us in Scripture alone (*sola Scriptura*).[^1]
