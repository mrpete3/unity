## First reading [Ezk 2:9‑3:10, 19 ESV]

[2:9] And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. [10] And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.

[3:1] And he said to me, “Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” [2] So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat. [3] And he said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.” Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.

[4] And he said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them. [5] For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel—[6] not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. [7] But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. [8] Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. [9] Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.” [10] Moreover, he said to me, “Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.

[19] But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.

## Epistle [2Tm 3:14‑4:4 ESV; sermon text]

[3:14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it
[15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
[16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, [17] that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

[1] I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: [2] preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. [3] For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, [4] and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 16:19‑31 ESV]

[19] “There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. [20] And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, [21] who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. [22] The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, [23] and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. [24] And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ [25] But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. [26] And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’
[27] And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house—[28] for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ [29] But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ [30] And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ [31] He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, two weeks ago I preached about grace; last week I preached about faith.
You may know what is coming: Scripture. *Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone.*
For during the Reformation, these were put together to make a slogan: *Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone.*
This third emphasis of the Reformation, *Scripture Alone*, is our topic this evening.

To realize how serious *Scripture Alone* is, you need look no further than Christ being tempted by Satan in the wilderness.
When our Lord was hungry, the tempter came to Him full of deceit and said, **"If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."**
And our Lord answered, **"_It is written_, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God'"** [(Mt&nbsp;4:3&#x2011;4 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%204%3A3-4/).
Christ had but one weapon against Satan: it was His own Word.
But to speak His Word, He quoted *the Bible*---He quoted *Scripture*.
Christ's own words, **"It is written,"** mean that we, too, must cling to Scripture: the inspired, inscripturated Word of God.

We have also in our Holy Gospel tonight another example of how serious *Scripture Alone* is.
The rich man died after having shown no mercy to Lazarus, and went to hell.
From there he *saw* Lazarus in heaven in Abraham's bosom.
The rich man in agony begged Abraham, **"I beg you, father, to send [Lazarus] to my father's house---for I have five brothers---so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment."**
But Abraham said, **"_They have Moses and the Prophets_---**they have the Scriptures**---_let them hear them._"** And [the rich man] said, **"No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent."**
Abraham said to the rich man, **"If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead"** [(Lk&nbsp;16:27&#x2011;31 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2016%3A27-31/).
In other words, Scripture alone is **able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.**
Reject the Scriptures and you have no hope.
Reject the Scriptures and you have rejected the means by which God has graciously revealed to you that though you have rebelled against Him and justly deserved His temporal and eternal punishment, Scripture reveals that He has nevertheless had mercy on you and forgiven you for the sake of His Son Jesus.
Believe in Him, and you are saved.
Scripture, from beginning to end, directs your faith toward Jesus.

This was the issue during the Reformation 500&nbsp;yeas ago, for in the Roman Catholic church there were, and still are today, _two_ sources of divine truth: the Scriptures and _church tradition_.
The Roman Catholic church taught, and still teaches today, that God has revealed His truth through the Roman Catholic church in ways that are not written in the Scriptures.
Here is word-for-word what is taught in the Roman Catholic catechism today:

> The Church, &hellip; does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone.
Both Scripture *and Tradition* must be accepted and honored with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.[^2]

[^2]: *Catechism of the Catholic Church*, 2nd ed., (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2016)  80 (p.&nbsp; 26)

But we, following Christ's own direction, derive our certainty *from Scripture alone*.
The issue raised in the Reformation was simply this:
There are doctrines and practices in the Roman Catholic church that come from tradition but nevertheless contradict Scripture.
These doctrines and practices should be discontinued because they contradict *what is written in the Scriptures*.

A clear example known to all is that Roman Catholic tradition prohibits priests from marrying.
What does Scripture say?

> **Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, _who forbid marriage_ and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.** [(1Tm&nbsp;4:1&#x2011;3 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Timothy%204%3A1-3/)

The prohibition of priests to marry is a doctrine of demons, says Scripture, and must be corrected.

A more convoluted example is the forgiveness of sins. The Number One Example of what Scripture clearly teaches is this: the forgiveness of sins is given to all who repent of their sins and believe that Jesus' death on the Cross atones for their sins.
The Roman Catholic catechism teaches,

> The Apostle's Creed associates faith in the forgiveness of sins not only with faith in the Holy Spirit, but also with faith in the Church and in the communion of saints.

Sounds confusing, but let us now listen to the testimony of the Scriptures.

> **And behold, some people brought to [Jesus] a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their _faith_, he said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.&rdquo;** [(Mt&nbsp;9:2 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+9:2/)

Here, faith *in Jesus* to heal prompts Him to declare forgiveness to the paralytic!

> **&ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.&rdquo;** [(Mt&nbsp;26:27&#x2011;28 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2026%3A27-28/)

And here, faith *in Jesus* to give us His blood in Holy Communion for the forgiveness of sins means that you are forgiven!
When Jesus says you are forgiven, you are forgiven!
Behind it all---behind Jesus saying you are forgiven by faith in Him---behind it *all* is His blood shed on the Cross to atone for your sins.
Scripture declares,

> **[Jesus] has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.** [(Heb&nbsp;9:26 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Hebrews%209%3A26/)

As the prophet Isaiah foretold,

> **But he was pierced for our transgressions;**\
> **he was crushed for our iniquities;**\
> **upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,**\
> **and with his wounds we are healed.**\
> **All we like sheep have gone astray;**\
> **we have turned---every one---to his own way;**\
> **and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.** [(Is&nbsp;53:5&#x2011;6 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2053%3A5-6/)

Jesus death was in our place bearing the punishment of our sins.
Scripture declares that by His sacrificial death He has put away sin once and for all---Scripture Alone.
By His work alone we are saved. Only believe in His work *for you*, and you are saved---Faith Alone.
Believe that God gives this faith and forgiveness to you as a gift without your earning it---Grace Alone.
*Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone.*
AMEN.

## Notes

A sinner is justified by grace alone (*sola gratia*) through faith alone (*sola fide*) for the sake of Christ alone (*solus Christus*), a truth revealed to us in Scripture alone (*sola Scriptura*).[^1]
