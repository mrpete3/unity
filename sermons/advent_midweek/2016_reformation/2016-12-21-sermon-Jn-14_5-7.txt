## First reading [Is 28:16‑18a, 19 ESV]

> [16] therefore thus says the Lord God,\
> “Behold, I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion,\
> a stone, a tested stone,\
> a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation:\
> ‘Whoever believes will not be in haste.’\
> [17] And I will make justice the line,\
> and righteousness the plumb line;\
> and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,\
> and waters will overwhelm the shelter.”\
> [18] Then your covenant with death will be annulled,\
> and your agreement with Sheol will not stand;

## Epistle [1Co 1:18‑25 ESV]

[18] For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. [19] For it is written,

> “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\
> and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”

[20] Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? [21] For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. [22] For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, [23] but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, [24] but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. [25] For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 14:5‑7 ESV]

[5] Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” [6] Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. [7] If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”

[5] Λέγει αὐτῷ Θωμᾶς, Κύριε, οὐκ οἴδαμεν ποῦ ὑπάγεις: πῶς δυνάμεθα τὴν ὁδὸν εἰδέναι; 
[6] λέγει αὐτῷ [ὁ] Ἰησοῦς, Ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ὁδὸς καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια καὶ ἡ ζωή: οὐδεὶς ἔρχεται πρὸς τὸν πατέρα εἰ μὴ δι' ἐμοῦ. 
[7] εἰ ἐγνώκατέ με, καὶ τὸν πατέρα μου γνώσεσθε: καὶ ἀπ' ἄρτι γινώσκετε αὐτὸν καὶ ἑωράκατε αὐτόν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, three weeks ago I preached about grace; two weeks ago I preached about faith; last week I preached about Scripture.
*Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone.*
These are pillars of the Christian faith taught by the apostles.
But these pillars had crumbled in the Roman Catholic church, and
when Martin Luther rediscovered them in the Bible, the Reformation was born 500 years ago.

Let us then look at what the Bible---Scripture---has to say.
St Paul was the great missionary to the Gentiles, and he put in a nutshell
in 1 Corinthians, chapter 1 what he preached:

> **For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, _but we preach Christ crucified_, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.** [(1Co&nbsp;1:22&#x2011;25)](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%201%3A22-25/)

*Christ crucified* is the main message not only of St Paul, but of the entire Bible!
Yes, even the Old Testament is about Christ crucified:

> **“I will put enmity between you and the woman,**\
> **and between your seed and her seed;**\
> **he shall bruise your head,**\
> **and you shall bruise his heel.”** [(Gn 3:15 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%203%3A15/)

The Seed of the Woman is Christ; the serpent is Satan.
Satan will bite Christ's heel, and that is a word picture of the crucifixion of Christ.

> **But he was pierced for our transgressions;**\
> **he was crushed for our iniquities;**\
> **upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,**\
> **and with his wounds we are healed.** [(Is 53:5 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2053%3A5/)

Let the nails that pierced our Lord's hands and feet be the serpent's teeth---and the spear that pierced His side.
Blood and water flowed out of the spear hole.
Let the blood of Holy Communion and the water of Holy Baptism be Jesus bruising Satan's head---let Baptism and Holy Communion be Jesus stomping on the serpent's head as he slithers over to bite you and kill you.
“Satan be gone! I belong to Christ!”
You see, the whole Bible is about Christ crucified!
But here, in Isaiah, chapter 53, the prophet proclaims *why, for what purpose* Christ was crucified:
He was crucified **for our transgressions; He was crushed for our iniquities**.
The purpose of the Cross of Christ is none other than He is our substitute, punished for our sins---dying that we may live.

You can go back and read about the scapegoat in Leviticus, chapter 16, on whose head Aaron confessed the sins of Israel and sent it alone into the wilderness to die.
It is written that **the goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area** [(Lv 16:22 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Leviticus%2016%3A22/).
Even the scapegoat proclaims the Cross of Christ, that by His atoning sacrifice, Jesus removes our sins from us as far as the east is from the west.

You can go back and read about Joseph in Genesis, chapter 50, who had suffered at the hands of his brothers.
But God used this injustice done to Joseph to save his brothers who hated him.
This, again, proclaims the Cross of Christ.
It is written that when Jacob died and Joseph's brothers were afraid that Joseph would take revenge on them, Joseph said to them, **“Do not fear, for am I in the place of God? As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.”** [(Gn 50:19‑20 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2050%3A19-20/).
So even Joseph is about the Cross of Christ, that Christ suffers injustice at the hands of His enemies---at the hands of sinners---that by His innocent suffering and death *our sins are now forgiven* and through this forgivness *we live* forever.

This is but a sampling of the Old Testament to show that if you are preaching and teaching from the Scriptures, you are preaching and teaching about **Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles**.

The worst thing that can happen is that you reject Cross of Christ for you.
Again, as it is written,

> **The stone that the builders rejected**\
> **has become the cornerstone.**\
> **This is the LORD's doing;**\
> **it is marvelous in our eyes.** [(Ps 118:22‑23 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm%20118%3A22-23/)

Here we have the proper picture of the Cross of Christ from a construction point of view---that Christ is the *only cornerstone that God has given to man* on which to build his house.
You can try to build your house on good works---try to build a house by doing good and trusting that your good works are your ticket to heaven.
But if you believe in your good works, you have rejected Christ as your cornerstone.
“I did this good. I did that good. I deserve God's reward of heaven.”
If this is how you build, Jesus is not the cornerstone. And what happens?

> **“The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.”** [(Mt 21:44 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2021%3A44/)

The worst thing you can do is to reject the cornerstone God has given you to build your house: the Cross of Christ.
There is no other cornerstone on which to build your house.
There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved, and **to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God**.
*Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone. ... Christ Alone.*
AMEN.
