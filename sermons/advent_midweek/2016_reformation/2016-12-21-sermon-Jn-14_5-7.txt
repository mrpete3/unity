## Epistle [1Co 1:18‑25 ESV]

[18] For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. [19] For it is written,

> “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\
> and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”

[20] Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? [21] For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. [22] For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, [23] but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, [24] but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. [25] For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 14:5‑7 ESV]

[5] Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” [6] Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. [7] If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”

[5] Λέγει αὐτῷ Θωμᾶς, Κύριε, οὐκ οἴδαμεν ποῦ ὑπάγεις: πῶς δυνάμεθα τὴν ὁδὸν εἰδέναι; 
[6] λέγει αὐτῷ [ὁ] Ἰησοῦς, Ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ὁδὸς καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια καὶ ἡ ζωή: οὐδεὶς ἔρχεται πρὸς τὸν πατέρα εἰ μὴ δι' ἐμοῦ. 
[7] εἰ ἐγνώκατέ με, καὶ τὸν πατέρα μου γνώσεσθε: καὶ ἀπ' ἄρτι γινώσκετε αὐτὸν καὶ ἑωράκατε αὐτόν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, three weeks ago I preached about grace; two weeks ago I preached about faith; last week I preached about Scripture.
*Grace Alone. Faith Alone. Scripture Alone.*
Believe it or not, these had been obscured in the Roman Catholic church.
When Martin Luther rediscovered them in the Bible, the Reformation was born.

Let us then look at what the Bible has to say.
St Paul was the great missionary to the Gentiles, and if he were to put in a nutshell what it is that he believed and preached, this is it:

> **For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, _but we preach Christ crucified_, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.** [(1Co&nbsp;1:22&#x2011;25)](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%201%3A22-25/)

AMEN.
