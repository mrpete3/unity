## Scripture reading [Jn 1:1‑28 ESV]

[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
[2] He was in the beginning with God. 
[3] All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 
[4] In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 
[5] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
 
[6] There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 
[7] He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. 
[8] He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

[9] The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 
[10] He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. 
[11] He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 
[12] But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, 
[13] who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

[14] And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 
[15] (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) 
[16] For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. 
[17] For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
[18] No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known. 

[19] And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” 
[20] He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” 
[21] And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” 
[22] So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 
[23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.” 

[24] (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) 
[25] They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 
[26] John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, 
[27] even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” 
[28] These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Our Advent theme this year will be Advent hymns:

* Today: _TLH_ 95 _Savior of the Nations, Come_
* December 13: _TLH_ 60 _Hark, a Thrilling Voice is Sounding_
* December 20: _TLH_ 62 _Oh, Come, Oh, Come, Emmanuel_

We have before us tonight, I have read, one of Luther's favorite hymns: _Savior of the Nations, Come_.
It is also one of the favorite hymns of Professor William Weinrich at the Fort Wayne seminary.
We sang this hymn in his early church history class and had to learn it by heart for the class.

What is it that we sing when we sing this hymn? (You may sing along if you wish.) *[Sing.]*

> *Savior of the nations come,*\
> *Virgin's Son, make there Thy home!*\
> *Marvel now, O heav'n and earth,*\
> *That the Lord chose such a birth.*

> *Not by human flesh and blood,*\
> *By the Spirit of our God,*\
> *Was the Word of God made flesh---*\
> *Woman's Offspring, pure and fresh.*

You may marvel at the rapid progress of technology, you may marvel at the rapid progress of medicine, but what about the rapid progress of sin?
Violence that years ago made us marvel is reported in the local news every day.
Sins against marriage that years ago made us marvel unless they were hidden in shame are now flaunted in public.
Marvel at how quickly the world has fallen by Satan's orchestration.

Yet when Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden---when they succumbed to Satan's lies---the LORD God said something to Satan that is important to hear and which includes the promise of a Savior to defeat Satan:

> **"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."** [(Gn 3:15 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+3&version=ESV)

Eve's offspring---*Woman's Offspring, pure and fresh*---shall bruise Satan's head---shall inflict a deadly blow on the dead of the ancient serpent, the devil [(Rv 12:9 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12:9&version=ESV).
We marvel at the promise that the Woman's Offspring will destroy the devil, for we know what it is to be a slave to Satan.
We are miserable---we are ashamed to be slaves of sin [(Jn 8:34)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8:34&version=ESV).
Let us *marvel* that the One to redeem us from our terrible taskmaster has come!

But *Marvel now, O heav'n and earth, That the Lord chose such a birth.*
Our Redeemer, the Savior of the Nations, comes in a most surprising way:
He chooses to be born of the virgin Mary.
First of all, it is impossible for a virgin to conceive, but then again, **"Nothing will be impossible with God"** [(Lk 1:37 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1&version=ESV), as the angel Gabriel told Mary.
Mary marveled that she, a virgin, would be the mother of the Son of God, but, thanks be to God, *she believed* it and the Holy Spirit overshadowed her and she became the *Woman* of *Woman's Offspring, pure and fresh*.

> *Wondrous birth! O wondrous Child*\
> *Of the Virgin undefiled!*\
> *Tho' by all the world disowned,*\
> *Still be be in heav'n enthroned.*

> *From the Father forth He came*\
> *And returneth to the same.*\
> *Captive leading death and hell---*\
> *High the song of triumph swell!*

The victory promised to us by the baby Savior born of a virgin is greater than our wildest dreams.
He will throw Satan off our backs---really!
Imagine life with Satan off our backs.
That time has come; that time is now!
But destroy Satan and what else have we got?
Death is destroyed!
Hell is vanquished! Alleuia!
The jaws of hell snap shut but we are safe outside those jaws because our Savior, our Good Shepherd, has grabbed us and kept us safe in His fold, the Church.
He promises that we will not die but live by the forgiveness of our sins.
**"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"** [(Rm 6:23 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=ESV).

Savior of the Nations, come, and make our hearts your home!
AMEN.
