## Scripture reading [Is 60:1‑7, 19‑20 ESV]

> [1] Arise, shine, for your light has come,\
> and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.\
> [2] For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,\
> and thick darkness the peoples;\
> but the LORD will arise upon you,\
> and his glory will be seen upon you.\
> [3] And nations shall come to your light,\
> and kings to the brightness of your rising.

> [4] Lift up your eyes all around, and see;\
> they all gather together, they come to you;\
> your sons shall come from afar,\
> and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.\
> [5] Then you shall see and be radiant;\
> your heart shall thrill and exult,\
> because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,\
> the wealth of the nations shall come to you.\
> [6] A multitude of camels shall cover you,\
> the young camels of Midian and Ephah;\
> all those from Sheba shall come.\
> They shall bring gold and frankincense,\
> and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.\
> [7] All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you;\
> the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you;\
> they shall come up with acceptance on my altar,\
> and I will beautify my beautiful house.

> [19] The sun shall be no more\
> your light by day,\
> nor for brightness shall the moon\
> give you light;\
> but the LORD will be your everlasting light,\
> and your God will be your glory.\
> [20] Your sun shall no more go down,\
> nor your moon withdraw itself;\
> for the LORD will be your everlasting light,\
> and your days of mourning shall be ended.
