## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

> **Lift up your heads, O gates!**\
> **And lift them up, O ancient doors,**\
> **that the King of glory may come in.**\
> **Who is this King of glory?**\
> **The Lord of hosts,**\
> **he is the King of glory!** ([Ps 24:9‑10](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+24:9/) ESV)

These words from Psalm 24 honor Christ our King at His coming---our King who comes to save us from our shame.
I have never prepared for a state visit by Queen Elizabeth, but what if I did?
The queen is coming to visit the United States and has heard so much about Cleveland that she wants to pay our city a visit, and for some reason she has chosen to visit our church of all the churches in Cleveland. What would we do?
Would the Governing Board meet to prepare for the queen's visit?
Would we make our best effort to get the building in shape?
Would we show up to church on the day she visits?
Advent is the season of preparation for Christ's own visit to sinful men; He comes to us through the womb of the virgin Mary.

The closer and closer the honored visitor comes, the more and more we make sure there are some things that the honored visitor does not see.
Shame---shame is powerful.
If the elevator inspector came to visit Unity, we might check the lift chair before he came.
But if Queen Elizabeth came, we would likely take action to make sure the roof does not leak into our sanctuary like it did once and everything else would get a major sprucing up.
You see, the power of shame increases with the importance of the person who sees it?
Our shame is greater before Queen Elizabeth than before the elevator inspector.
The more honor you give a person, the more shame you would feel before him for anything that made you look bad.

> **Behold, your king is coming to you;**\
> **righteous and having salvation is he.**

If you were harboring a secret sin---a secret shame---and Jesus came, you would be embarrassed.
Suppose, God forbid, you worked at Giant Eagle and were in the habit of stealing peanuts from there, and your friend, who works with you, knew about it but looked the other way.
Now if both your friend and you knew that Jesus was coming but you thought, "He won't find out that I steal peanuts," what would your friend do?
He would make sure he was nowhere near you when Jesus came!
Sin is a shame, but association with shame is embarrassing, too; people clear the shame zone quicker than a bomb threat.

> **Behold, your king is coming to you;**\
> **righteous and having salvation is he.**

He is coming *right into* your shame zone.
In all seriousness, this Advent season is prime opportunity to repent of your secret sins.
Secret sins, however, get easily entwined in your souls that you may not even recognize them.
The best way to know if these sins have wrapped you up is if someone sees it and tells you about it and right away you get mad!
Jesus came as it was foretold by the prophets---right into your shame zone.

> **Behold, your king is coming to you;**\
> **righteous and having salvation is he.**

And He says to you,
"Beloved,"---He need not say, "Beloved in the Lord" because He is the Lord---"Beloved, I am not afraid of your shame. I am here for you, you thief." ...

> **And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.** ([Mk 15:27](https://www.esv.org/Mark+15:27/) ESV)

Behold your King Jesus, who came right into your shame zone.
He did not come to analyze your shame and prove you wrong: He came to bear your shame and remove it from you as far as the east is from the west.
Behold so brightly in your heart the thief who believed in Jesus.
The thief's shame had been found out and he was being rightly crucified for it.
But Jesus, as you know, had done no wrong.
Yet there He was, gladly bearing the thief's shame with him.
Beloved in the Lord, this is why Jesus came, to bear his shame with him, and this is why He came, to bear your shame with you.
None of us thinks of the believing thief with any kind of contempt.
Why?
Because he confessed his sin:

> **"We are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."** ([Lk 23:41](https://www.esv.org/Luke+23:41/) ESV)

He confessed his sin and believed in Jesus.

> **He said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” And [Jesus] said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”** ([Lk 23:42‑43](https://www.esv.org/Luke+23:42/) ESV)

By faith Jesus turns your shame zone to the gates of Paradise.
Jesus is your King---your King of Shame who walks in on you shame and bears it for you.
By faith in Him, He gives you His righteousness so that you need be ashamed no longer.
Alleluia!

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
