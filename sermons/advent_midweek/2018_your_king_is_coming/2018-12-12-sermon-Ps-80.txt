## Ps 80 ESV

> [1] Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,\
> you who lead Joseph like a flock.\
> You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.\
> [2] 	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,\
> stir up your might\
> and come to save us!

> [3] Restore us, O God;\
> let your face shine, that we may be saved!

> [4] O LORD God of hosts,\
> how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?\
> [5] You have fed them with the bread of tears\
> and given them tears to drink in full measure.\
> [6] You make us an object of contention for our neighbors,\
> and our enemies laugh among themselves.

> [7] Restore us, O God of hosts;\
> let your face shine, that we may be saved!

> [8] You brought a vine out of Egypt;\
> you drove out the nations and planted it.\
> [9] You cleared the ground for it;\
> it took deep root and filled the land.\
> [10] The mountains were covered with its shade,\
> the mighty cedars with its branches.\
> [11] It sent out its branches to the sea\
> and its shoots to the River.\
> [12] Why then have you broken down its walls,\
> so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?\
> [13] The boar from the forest ravages it,\
> and all that move in the field feed on it.


> [14] Turn again, O God of hosts!\
> Look down from heaven, and see;\
> have regard for this vine,\
> [15] 	the stock that your right hand planted,\
> and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.\
> [16] They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down;\
> may they perish at the rebuke of your face!\
> [17] But let your hand be on the man of your right hand,\
> the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!\
> [18] Then we shall not turn back from you;\
> give us life, and we will call upon your name!


> [19] Restore us, O LORD God of hosts!\
> Let your face shine, that we may be saved!

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Last week Jesus was our King of Shame.
Since He came to bear our guilt and shame, this week, we receive Him also as our King of Guilt.

Our reading tonight is all of Psalm 80.
You may remember from Sunday that it is a bad idea to be distracted by sin and to miss the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ---that is a bad idea.
Yet Ps 80 is a powerful prayer that *confesses* our sin as we pray,

> **O LORD God of hosts,**\
> **how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?**

Yes, it is possible for God to be angry with our prayers.
If we are distracted by sin, God is angry with our prayers.
If we are caught up with worldliness and false gods, then we put our hope in false gods and the world.
How can God be happy with our prayers if our hope is in the world and idols?
He is not!
But in Psalm 80, we admit our guilt and forsake our idols and pray to God anyway,
for our idols are powerless to save us from the trouble that is upon us.

> **You have fed them with the bread of tears**\
> **and given them tears to drink in full measure.**\
> **You make us an object of contention for our neighbors,**\
> **and our enemies laugh among themselves.**

Yes, our enemies laugh because we are defeated by our own sin.
We took You, O Lord, for granted.
We despised Your good gifts.
We didn't listen to You.
Nevertheless, O Lord, hear us---because of *who You are*.

> **Restore us,** from our sin, **O God of hosts;**\
> **let your face shine, that we may be saved!**

Well now you are praying to the right God---the only God---the one, true God of Israel---for He is ready to restore us from our sin.

> **But let your hand be on the man of your right hand,**\
> **the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!**\
> **Then we shall not turn back from you;**\
> **give us life, and we will call upon your name!**

Our confession of sin is the premise of our prayer in Psalm 80, and this is a very good premise---it is a very wise premise with which to pray before God.
In other words, we admit our guilt but pray to God anyway that he restore us from our sin.
God loves to hear this prayer and, beloved in the Lord, hear now about the One in whom we hope:

> **But let your hand be on the man of your right hand,**\
> **the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!**\

Yes, we know who God is.
We know who the Son of Man is---Jesus---Son of Man *and* Son of God, who is strong and has the power to save us from our sin.
Devil be gone! Jesus is here!
Our hope is not so much an idea about God as much as it is in that *we know who God is*.
**"Whoever has seen Me has seen the Father"** ([Jn 14:9](https://www.esv.org/John+14:9/)), says our Lord Jesus, Son of God and Son of Man.
He is our King of Guilt---the one we pray to save us from the guilt of our sins.
Stained with sin and confessing our sin, we pray to be saved, and He comes.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
