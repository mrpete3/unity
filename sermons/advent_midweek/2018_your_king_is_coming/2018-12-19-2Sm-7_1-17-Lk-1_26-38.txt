## 2Sm 7:1‑17 ESV

[1] Now when the king lived in his house and the LORD had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies, [2] the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.” [3] And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”

[4] But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, [5] “Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: Would you build me a house to dwell in? [6] I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling. [7] In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’ [8] Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel. [9] And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. [10] And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, [11] from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. [12] When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. [13] He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. [14] I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, [15] but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. [16] And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’” [17] In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.

## Lk 1:26‑38 ESV

[26] In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, [27] to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. [28] And he came to her and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” [29] But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. [30] And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. [31] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. [32] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, [33] and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”

[34] And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”

[35] And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.
[36] And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. [37] For nothing will be impossible with God.”
[38] And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Last week Jesus was our King of Guilt, and the week before that, He was our King of Shame.
Today He comes to us as our King of the Low.
In our readings tonight, we have three of the low: First, we have Elizabeth, then we have Mary, and then we have the shepherd boy David.

The angel Gabriel had announced to Zechariah, Elizabeth's husband, that Elizabeth would conceive in her old age and bear a son.
When she did conceive, she said, **"Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people"** ([Lk 1:25](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1:25/) ESV), for she was a childless, elderly Jewish woman.
Elizabeth was one of the low.
In Jewish society a woman's status was, and still is to an extent, defined by her marriage and her having given birth to and raised children.
In this view Elizabeth was the among the least prominent of Jewish women---"At least," some might have said, "she is married to a priest."

Look at the low who lose and there you find whom God will choose.
Look at old, barren Elizabeth, who bears the reproach among her people for being childless and there you find the woman whom God chooses to be mother of John the Baptist.
God is warming up.

The virgin Mary is not old and barren, but young and engaged to be married.
What is peculiar of her circumstance is that no mention is made in the Bible of her parents, and it appears that Joseph is the one who cares for her.
This would imply that Mary is a teenage orphan who normally would still live with her parents during her engagement, but because she her parents are no longer there to care for her, Joseph cares for her and respects her chastity as he intends to marry her.
In any case, Mary is definitely *not* a princess in a king's palace---quite the opposite.
She has lost her parents and is lucky enough to have found a respectable man who wants to marry her.

Look at the low who lose and there you find whom God will choose.
Now of all the people that God would choose, knowing from the Bible that God the Father had decided before creation that He would send His Son to save sinful man, what a big choice it was for God to choose the one woman of all women who would give birth to God incarnate: Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, the Son of God.
Mary is by far the most significant woman in all of history.
But who is she but a lowly virgin engaged to be married like all the others?

We have in our reading from Luke tonight the aspect of Mary that the Bible sheds the greatest light on; it is summed up in her own words: **"Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word."**
First of all, Mary is willing to go along with whatever God has to say, even at her own personal risk.
Being pregnant out of wedlock would put her life at risk for being punished for fornication, but though the risk was real, she trusted God's word nevertheless.
Being pregnant before marriage to Joseph would put an end to her hopes of being married to him.
It seems likely that someone with such a tenuous situation in life as Mary, who finally has hope to marry Joseph and raise a family and have something nice in her life, would resist the angel Gabriel's announcement and say, "Angel Gabriel, can you please find someone else to be what you describe?"

What did Mary answer? **"How will this be, since I am a virgin?"**
Instead of deflecting God's will for her, she answers in faith but speaks up in regard to her honor, which was intact, and which she protected as she hoped to marry Joseph.
God would not only protect her honor but elevate it to be above that of all women.

> **And the angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy---the Son of God."**

Mary was one of the low, and the point to remember from tonight is that it is precisely Mary whom God chose to bear His only Son as a man.
This Son, conceived in a virgin, was to inherit the throne of David, to whom we turn next.
Who was David when God chose him?
A lowly shepherd.
David also was one of the low.
David, Mary, Elizabeth---low, low, low.
Look at the low who lose and there you find whom God will choose.

Our King Jesus is lowly Himself.
He looks for us in our sinful lowliness, takes on our lowliness, dies in lowliness, and then gives us His glory.
He is our King of the Low.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
