## First reading [Rv 7:2‑17 ESV]

[2] Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea, [3] saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.” [4] And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:

> [5] 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,\
> [6] 12,000 from the tribe of Asher,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,\
> [7] 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Levi,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,\
> [8] 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
	
	
[9] After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, [10] and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” [11] And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, [12] saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”

[13] Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?” [14] I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

> [15] “Therefore they are before the throne of God,\
> and serve him day and night in his temple;\
> and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.\
> [16] They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;\
> the sun shall not strike them,\
> nor any scorching heat.\
> [17] For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,\
> and he will guide them to springs of living water,\
> and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”

[2] καὶ εἶδον ἄλλον ἄγγελον ἀναβαίνοντα ἀπὸ ἀνατολῆς ἡλίου, ἔχοντα σφραγῖδα θεοῦ ζῶντος, καὶ ἔκραξεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ τοῖς τέσσαρσιν ἀγγέλοις οἷς ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς ἀδικῆσαι τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, 
[3] λέγων, Μὴ ἀδικήσητε τὴν γῆν μήτε τὴν θάλασσαν μήτε τὰ δένδρα ἄχρι σφραγίσωμεν τοὺς δούλους τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ τῶν μετώπων αὐτῶν. 
[4] καὶ ἤκουσα τὸν ἀριθμὸν τῶν ἐσφραγισμένων, ἑκατὸν τεσσεράκοντα τέσσαρες χιλιάδες, ἐσφραγισμένοι ἐκ πάσης φυλῆς υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ:

> [5] ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰούδα δώδεκα χιλιάδες ἐσφραγισμένοι, ἐκ φυλῆς Ῥουβὴν δώδεκα χιλιάδες, ἐκ φυλῆς Γὰδ δώδεκα χιλιάδες,\
> [6] ἐκ φυλῆς Ἀσὴρ δώδεκα χιλιάδες, ἐκ φυλῆς Νεφθαλὶμ δώδεκα χιλιάδες, ἐκ φυλῆς Μανασσῆ δώδεκα χιλιάδες,\
> [7] ἐκ φυλῆς Συμεὼν δώδεκα χιλιάδες, ἐκ φυλῆς Λευὶ δώδεκα χιλιάδες, ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰσσαχὰρ δώδεκα χιλιάδες,\
> [8] ἐκ φυλῆς Ζαβουλὼν δώδεκα χιλιάδες, ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰωσὴφ δώδεκα χιλιάδες, ἐκ φυλῆς Βενιαμὶν δώδεκα χιλιάδες ἐσφραγισμένοι.\

[9] Μετὰ ταῦτα εἶδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὄχλος πολύς, ὃν ἀριθμῆσαι αὐτὸν οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο, ἐκ παντὸς ἔθνους καὶ φυλῶν καὶ λαῶν καὶ γλωσσῶν, ἑστῶτες ἐνώπιον τοῦ θρόνου καὶ ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἀρνίου, περιβεβλημένους στολὰς λευκάς, καὶ φοίνικες ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν: 
[10] καὶ κράζουσιν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ λέγοντες, Ἡ σωτηρία τῷ θεῷ ἡμῶν τῷ καθημένῳ ἐπὶ τῷ θρόνῳ καὶ τῷ ἀρνίῳ. 
[11] καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄγγελοι εἱστήκεισαν κύκλῳ τοῦ θρόνου καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ τῶν τεσσάρων ζῴων, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐνώπιον τοῦ θρόνου ἐπὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν καὶ προσεκύνησαν τῷ θεῷ, 
[12] λέγοντες, Ἀμήν: ἡ εὐλογία καὶ ἡ δόξα καὶ ἡ σοφία καὶ ἡ εὐχαριστία καὶ ἡ τιμὴ καὶ ἡ δύναμις καὶ ἡ ἰσχὺς τῷ θεῷ ἡμῶν εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων: ἀμήν. 
[13] Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς ἐκ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων λέγων μοι, Οὗτοι οἱ περιβεβλημένοι τὰς στολὰς τὰς λευκὰς τίνες εἰσὶν καὶ πόθεν ἦλθον; 
[14] καὶ εἴρηκα αὐτῷ, Κύριέ μου, σὺ οἶδας. καὶ εἶπέν μοι, Οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ ἐρχόμενοι ἐκ τῆς θλίψεως τῆς μεγάλης, καὶ ἔπλυναν τὰς στολὰς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐλεύκαναν αὐτὰς ἐν τῷ αἵματι τοῦ ἀρνίου. 

> [15] διὰ τοῦτό εἰσιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ θρόνου τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ λατρεύουσιν αὐτῷ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς ἐν τῷ ναῷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ καθήμενος ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου σκηνώσει ἐπ' αὐτούς.\
> [16] οὐ πεινάσουσιν ἔτι οὐδὲ διψήσουσιν ἔτι, οὐδὲ μὴ πέσῃ ἐπ' αὐτοὺς ὁ ἥλιος οὐδὲ πᾶν καῦμα,\
> [17] ὅτι τὸ ἀρνίον τὸ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ θρόνου ποιμανεῖ αὐτούς, καὶ ὁδηγήσει αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ ζωῆς πηγὰς ὑδάτων: καὶ ἐξαλείψει ὁ θεὸς πᾶν δάκρυον ἐκ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν.

## Epistle [1Jn 3:1‑3 ESV; sermon text]

[1] See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. [2] Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. [3] And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

------------

[1] ἴδετε ποταπὴν ἀγάπην δέδωκεν ἡμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ἵνα τέκνα θεοῦ κληθῶμεν: καὶ ἐσμέν. διὰ τοῦτο ὁ κόσμος οὐ γινώσκει ἡμᾶς ὅτι οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτόν. 
[2] Ἀγαπητοί, νῦν τέκνα θεοῦ ἐσμεν, καὶ οὔπω ἐφανερώθη τί ἐσόμεθα. οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἐὰν φανερωθῇ ὅμοιοι αὐτῷ ἐσόμεθα, ὅτι ὀψόμεθα αὐτὸν καθώς ἐστιν. 
[3] καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἔχων τὴν ἐλπίδα ταύτην ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἁγνίζει ἑαυτὸν καθὼς ἐκεῖνος ἁγνός ἐστιν.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 5:1‑12 ESV]

[1] Seeing the crowds, [Jesus] went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.

[2] And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:

[3] “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[4] “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

[5] “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

[6] “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

[7] “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.

[8] “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

[9] “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

[10] “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[11] “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

[10] μακάριοι οἱ δεδιωγμένοι ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης, ὅτι αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν.

[11] μακάριοί ἐστε ὅταν ὀνειδίσωσιν ὑμᾶς καὶ διώξωσιν καὶ εἴπωσιν πᾶν πονηρὸν καθ' ὑμῶν [ψευδόμενοι] ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ: 
[12] χαίρετε καὶ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε, ὅτι ὁ μισθὸς ὑμῶν πολὺς ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς: οὕτως γὰρ ἐδίωξαν τοὺς προφήτας τοὺς πρὸ ὑμῶν.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we did not get our parade. Our hopes---the hopes of Indians fans---came crashing down in the 10th inning of Game 7 of the World Series.
And the painful reality is that our hope of joy turned to misery right away.
We thought we had played well enough to win, &hellip; but we did not.

Beloved in the Lord, we did not play well enough to win in more than one way.
For we heard with our own ears this past Reformation Sunday:

> **By works of the law no human being will be justified in [God's] sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.** [(Rm&nbsp;3:20)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%203%3A20/)

The greatest parade possible is to be justified in God's sight,
where God---in front of everyone---puts us on the back of a convertible and rides us through downtown New Jerusalem and declares us to be innocent, declares us to be righteous, declares us to be His own kingdom of priests as angels and the countless multitude cheer us on.
And if we had played well enough---well enough by the Ten Commandments---from _**You shall have no other gods**_ to _**You shall not steal**_ to _**You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor**_---if we had played well enough by God's Law, we *would* be justified in God's sight.
And God would tell us,
**&ldquo;Well done, good servant!&rdquo;** [(Lk&nbsp;19:17)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+19:17/)

Yet by these Ten  Holy Commandments---by God's Law---none of us have earned a righteous parade where God rejoices.
Instead, all of us have only the knowledge of sin.
With evil on our hands, we have no parade where God is smiling: we have only punishment where God is angry.

> **The voice of the LORD cries to the city:**\
> **“Hear of the rod and of him who appointed it!**\
> **Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales**\
> **and with a bag of deceitful weights?**\
> **Your rich men are full of violence;**\
> [all of] **your inhabitants speak lies,**\
> **and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.**\
> **Therefore I strike you with a grievous blow,**\
> **making you desolate because of your sins.**\
> **You shall eat, but not be satisfied,**\
> **and there shall be hunger within you.”** [(Mi&nbsp;6:9a, 11&#x2011;14a ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Micah%206%3A9-14/)

Beloved in the Lord, the hunger *within* us to be justified before God cannot be filled by our own works, for they are evil, and even if we think of them as good, they are tainted with sin and are as filthy rags to God [(Is&nbsp;64:6)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah+64:6/).
The hunger within St&nbsp;Peter to be justified before God caused him to fall down at Jesus' knees and cry out, **&ldquo;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord&rdquo;** [(Lk&nbsp;5:8 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+5:8/).
The hunger within St&nbsp;Sinful Woman caused her to wet Jesus' feet with her tears and wipe them with her hair and kiss them and anoint them with ointment [(Lk&nbsp;7:38)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%207%3A38/).
The hunger within St&nbsp;Centurion caused him to call for Jesus to ask Him to heal his servant.
But when Jesus said, **&ldquo;I will come and heal him,&rdquo;** the centurion replied, as you may recall, **&ldquo;Lord, *I am not worthy* to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed&rdquo;** [(Mt&nbsp;8:6&#x2011;8)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%208%3A6-8/).
But to all three---to St&nbsp;Centurion, to St&nbsp;Sinful Woman, and to St&nbsp;Peter---each one hungry to be justified before God---each one turning to Jesus one after the other---to all three our Lord Jesus says, from the Holy Gospel, **&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven&rdquo;** [(Mt&nbsp;5:3)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%205%3A3/).
When you and I despair of our own works and worthiness and turn to Jesus, blessed are *we*, for *ours* is the kingdom of heaven.

And we get our parade after all.
There is joy and recognition in heaven over every one of us who repents.
As you well know:
**&ldquo;There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance&rdquo;** [(Lk&nbsp;15:7 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+15:7/).
For the sake of Jesus---for the sake of faith in Jesus that *He* is the one by whom our sins are forgiven by His punishment for *our* sins in *our* place on the Cross---by faith in Jesus, our status switches from condemned to justified, from darkness to light, from death---where Satan wants to die with us---to life---where Jesus wants to live with us forever in heaven! 

From our reading in the book of Revelation, hear the great congregation *in heaven* that praises God.
The great heavenly multitude sings,

> **&ldquo;Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!&rdquo;**

The angels in heaven respond,

> **&ldquo;Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.&rdquo;**

There is a big, long, extended hymn of praise from the beginning to the end of Revelation, sung by the multitudes in heaven. And we are blessed to hear a part of it today in our reading from Revelation.

> **&ldquo;These are the ones&rdquo;**\
> (and this could be the song sung at our victory parade in heaven)\
> **&ldquo;These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation.**\
> **They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.**\
> **Therefore they are before the throne of God,**\
> **and serve him day and night in his temple;**\
> **and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.**\
> **They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;**\
> **the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat.**\
> **For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,**\
> **and he will guide them to springs of living water,**\
> **and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&rdquo;**

And I wish, and so do you, that we could hear the music with the words.
We *will* soon enough hear the music in heaven, but until then, we must do our best to praise God here on earth according to our faith.
And we will do so after the sermon when we sing the *Te Deum*.
For those of you not familiar with it, *Te Deum* means *You, O God,* as in *You, O God, we praise.*[^3]
If you have never sung it before and you are able to read music, please follow along on p&nbsp;35 in the red hymnal.
If you have never sung it before and you are *not* able to read music, please follow along in your bulletin.
And if you have sung it before, here we go! Our heavenly hymn of praise to God our Savior from sin, death, devil, and hell!

Will we really sing a heavenly hymn of praise?
Yes, we will.
**Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared.**
We are God's children *now*, and entitled to praise God because though we are still on earth, our hearts have turned to Jesus and *ours is the kingdom of heaven*.
We will be St&nbsp;Mark and Unity singing together, but there will be others, too.
The angels will have the birds-eye view, the cherubim and seraphim will swoop back and forth along the parade route, the glorious company of the Apostles will march behind a banner that says *The Twelve Apostles: Fishers of Men*, the goodly fellowship of the prophets will be pulled on a float and throw candy to the crowd, the noble army of martyrs will be the marching and, and the holy Church throughout the world will join us.
Let us sing then the hymn of our victory parade.
AMEN.

## Notes

Eph 1:13. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.

Eph 4:30. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

Rv 7:10. Ἡ σωτηρία τῷ θεῷ ἡμῶν … καὶ τῷ ἀρνίῳ. Brighton argues that this is a dative *of possession*.[^4]
This is a salvation originating from God and from the Lamb.

Rv 11:15. **Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.”** This is the only time in the entire Bible where the kingdom of God and of Christ is also identified as "the kingdom of the cosmos."[^1]

Brighton teaches *The Great Te Deum of Praise in Revelation* (4:8, 11; 5:9‑10, 12; 7:10, 14‑17; 12:10‑12; 19:6‑8; 11:17‑18; 15:3‑4; 16:5‑7; 19:1‑3).[^2]

Think of who Jesus is and who you are.

1Jn 1:7. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.

1Jn 1:10. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.


1Jn 2:1‑6. My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.

1Jn 2:8. At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.


1Jn 3:6‑8. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.

1Jn 3:12. We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous.

1Jn 3:23‑24. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.

1Jn 4:11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

1Jn 4:17‑19. By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.
We love because he first loved us.

1Jn 5:3‑5. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

Jn 13:34‑35. “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”
