## First reading [Rv 7:2‑17 ESV]

[2] Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea, [3] saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.” [4] And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:

> [5] 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,\
> [6] 12,000 from the tribe of Asher,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,\
> [7] 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Levi,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,\
> [8] 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
	
	
[9] After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, [10] and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” [11] And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, [12] saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”

[13] Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?” [14] I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

> [15] “Therefore they are before the throne of God,\
> and serve him day and night in his temple;\
> and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.\
> [16] They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;\
> the sun shall not strike them,\
> nor any scorching heat.\
> [17] For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,\
> and he will guide them to springs of living water,\
> and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”

## Epistle [1Jn 3:1‑3 ESV]

[1] See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. [2] Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. [3] And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 5:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.

[2] And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:

[3] “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[4] “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

[5] “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

[6] “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

[7] “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.

[8] “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

[9] “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

[10] “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[11] “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

[1] Ἰδὼν δὲ τοὺς ὄχλους ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος: καὶ καθίσαντος αὐτοῦ προσῆλθαν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ: 
[2] καὶ ἀνοίξας τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ ἐδίδασκεν αὐτοὺς λέγων, 

[3] Μακάριοι οἱ πτωχοὶ τῷ πνεύματι, ὅτι αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν. 

[4] μακάριοι οἱ πενθοῦντες, ὅτι αὐτοὶ παρακληθήσονται. 

[5] μακάριοι οἱ πραεῖς, ὅτι αὐτοὶ κληρονομήσουσιν τὴν γῆν. 

[6] μακάριοι οἱ πεινῶντες καὶ διψῶντες τὴν δικαιοσύνην, ὅτι αὐτοὶ χορτασθήσονται. 

[7] μακάριοι οἱ ἐλεήμονες, ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἐλεηθήσονται. 

[8] μακάριοι οἱ καθαροὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ, ὅτι αὐτοὶ τὸν θεὸν ὄψονται. 

[9] μακάριοι οἱ εἰρηνοποιοί, ὅτι αὐτοὶ υἱοὶ θεοῦ κληθήσονται. 

[10] μακάριοι οἱ δεδιωγμένοι ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης, ὅτι αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν. 

[11] μακάριοί ἐστε ὅταν ὀνειδίσωσιν ὑμᾶς καὶ διώξωσιν καὶ εἴπωσιν πᾶν πονηρὸν καθ' ὑμῶν [ψευδόμενοι] ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ: 
[12] χαίρετε καὶ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε, ὅτι ὁ μισθὸς ὑμῶν πολὺς ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς: οὕτως γὰρ ἐδίωξαν τοὺς προφήτας τοὺς πρὸ ὑμῶν.

## Collect

Almighty and everlasting God, You knit together Your faithful people of all times and places into one holy communion, the mystical body of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Grant us so to follow Your blessed saints in all virtuous and godly living that, together with them, we may come to the unspeakable joys You have prepared for those who love You; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Responsive Prayer (adapted from prayer for Armed Forces Day)

**L:** Lord God, You have sustained our nation in the past and continue to bless us. We recall how so many have given their lives for the cause of freedom. Men and women continue to sacrifice
and serve in the armed forces. Today, we pause to reflect and honor those
who gave or who continue to sacrifice so much in the defense of our freedom to be faithful.

**R: We remember the great courage and selfless service of so many
throughout history who have answered the call to serve. We remember their honorable sacrifice for the freedom of others. Comfort the families who mourn the loss of loved ones. Comfort also those who suffer permanent injuries as a result of serving our nation in the military.**

**L:** We remember with thankfulness the millions of Americans who give
so generously of their life and labor in times of national conflict, particularly the family members of our soldiers, sailors, aircrew, Marines and Coast Guardsmen.

**R: We are grateful for the devotion and sacrifices of military families.
Grant us the resources and willing hearts to support them.**

**L:** Lord, You prayed earnestly for Your disciples, that they would be
kept in Your name, filled with joy and sanctified in Your Word of Truth.

**R: Keep our chaplains in Your name. Fill them with the joy that comes
from knowing You have defeated sin and death. Sanctify their ministry in
Your Word of truth.**

**L:** Gracious Lord, we ask for Your strength for our chaplains who serve
in the wounded-warrior wards and in our military hospitals as they provide
pastoral care to hurting and wounded veterans and their families.

**R: Lord, mend the wounds of all who suffer in body, mind or spirit. Grant their physicians knowledge and wisdom as they seek the best treatments for patients’ suffering.**

**L:** God of mercy, grant patience and insight to our chaplains who serve in all branches of our armed forces and the Civil Air Patrol. Only through Your sustaining love can they move out daily with confidence and joy. These and all things we ask through Your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and rules with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

**Amen.**
