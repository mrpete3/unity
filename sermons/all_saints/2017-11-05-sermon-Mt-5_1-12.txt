## First reading [Rv 7:2‑17 ESV]

[2] Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea, [3] saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.” [4] And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:

> [5] 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,\
> [6] 12,000 from the tribe of Asher,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,\
> [7] 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Levi,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,\
> [8] 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph,\
> 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
	
	
[9] After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, [10] and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” [11] And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, [12] saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”

[13] Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?” [14] I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

> [15] “Therefore they are before the throne of God,\
> and serve him day and night in his temple;\
> and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.\
> [16] They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;\
> the sun shall not strike them,\
> nor any scorching heat.\
> [17] For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,\
> and he will guide them to springs of living water,\
> and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”

## Epistle [1Jn 3:1‑3 ESV]

[1] See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. [2] Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. [3] And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 5:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.

[2] And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:

[3] “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[4] “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

[5] “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

[6] “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

[7] “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.

[8] “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

[9] “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

[10] “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

[11] “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

Grant us so to follow Your blessed saints in all virtuous and godly living that, together with them, we may come to the unspeakable joys You have prepared for those who love You; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Responsive Prayer (prayer borrowed from Armed Forces Day)

**L:** Lord God, You have sustained our nation in the past and continue to bless us. We recall how so many have given their lives for the cause of freedom. Men and women continue to sacrifice
and serve in the armed forces. Today, we pause to reflect and honor those
who gave or who continue to sacrifice so much in the defense of our freedom to be faithful.

**R: We remember the great courage and selfless service of so many
throughout history who have answered the call to serve. We remember their honorable sacrifice for the freedom of others. Comfort the families who mourn the loss of loved ones. Comfort also those who suffer permanent injuries as a result of serving our nation in the military.**

**L:** We remember with thankfulness the millions of Americans who give
so generously of their life and labor in times of national conflict, particularly the family members of our soldiers, sailors, aircrew, Marines and Coast Guardsmen.

**R: We are grateful for the devotion and sacrifices of military families.
Grant us the resources and willing hearts to support them.**

**L:** Lord, You prayed earnestly for Your disciples, that they would be
kept in Your name, filled with joy and sanctified in Your Word of Truth.

**R: Keep our chaplains in Your name. Fill them with the joy that comes
from knowing You have defeated sin and death. Sanctify their ministry in
Your Word of truth.**

**L:** Gracious Lord, we ask for Your strength for our chaplains who serve
in the wounded-warrior wards and in our military hospitals as they provide
pastoral care to hurting and wounded veterans and their families.

**R: Lord, mend the wounds of all who suffer in body, mind or spirit. Grant their physicians knowledge and wisdom as they seek the best treatments for patients’ suffering.**

**L:** God of mercy, grant patience and insight to our chaplains who serve in all branches of our armed forces and the Civil Air Patrol. Only through Your sustaining love can they move out daily with confidence and joy. <!-- These and all things we ask through Your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and rules with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.-->

**Amen.**

## Concluding responsive prayer for All Saints

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Our Holy Gospel today, for All Saints' Day, is the Beatitudes.

> **"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."**

This is the beginning of our Lord's teaching in the Sermon on the Mount and *[Point to the Sermon on the Mount window.]* our sanctuary is blessed with a window depicting this teaching.

**"The poor in spirit, those who mourn, the meek"** paint a picture of people who are having a rough time.
You might think that things would be better if I were rich in spirit, rejoicing, and bold, but our Lord turns it around:

> **"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.**\
> **Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.**\
> **Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."**

For it is a wonderful thing to be blessed before God---to be blessed is to stand in God's favor---to be blessed is when He looks at who I am, when He looks at what I do, when He looks into my heart at what I think and says, "This one is mine."

Yet if I would look in my heart---if I would remember what Scripture plainly says---if I would remember from last week---

> **"None is righteous, no, not one;**\
> **no one understands; no one seeks for God.**\
> **All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;**\
> **no one does good, not even one.”** [(Rm 3:10‑12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3/)

then by God's holy Ten Commandments is stand condemned, not blessed.
For these Commandments---**"You shall have no other gods. ... You shall not covet."**---are more than enough for God to just as well have nothing to do with me.
I have served my false god and have fallen into idolatry.
I have served my works---that others would recoginize what I do and give me glory and maybe even some money.
I have served my lusts---if it feels good, do it.
I have been disobedient, unfaithful, and lazy; hot-tempered, rude, and quarrelsome; and that is all I ever was and all I ever will be ... until Jesus got involved.

*[Point at the Chistmas window.]* Jesus stepped into my world and yours when He was born of the virgin Mary.
He shares the same weak flesh I have, even though He is God.
*[Point at Baptism window.]* Jesus stepped into the Jordan River and was baptized *with* sinners to show the public that _He is here **for** sinners_---He is here for me, no matter how foul my thoughts, words, and deeds.
My foul thoughts, words, and deeds deserve severe punishment and hell, *[Point to the Crucifixion window.]* but Jesus got involved and handled that on the Cross. Alleluia!
He sacrifices Himself and goes after the one lost sheep who needs to repent and leaves the ninety-nine righteous ones to graze.
Lord, thank you for the true repentance by which our Good Shepherd Jesus brought me into to His fold, rejoicing as He carried me on His shoulders!
And now I get the idea of what it means to be *blessed*.
I am blessed when Jesus gets involved; I am blessed when my sins are forgiven by faith in His name; I am blessed when I am brought into Christ's flock.

> **"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.**\
> **Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy."**\

If I would hold up my works to God and seek His approval for my efforts, I would indeed hunger and thirst for righteousness, for He would find nothing good that I have done---everything has been tainted by sin.
But since Jesus got involved, things are different.
*Christ's* righteousness---not my own, but *Christ's* righteousness---is given to me by faith, and Christ has done all things well.
*[Point to baptismal font.]* Christ's righteousness is given to me as surely as I am baptized in His name---**"For as many of you who as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ"** [(Gal 3:27 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+3/).

As happy as I am now to be blessed, I am not the only one.
My relationship with Jesus is not the only thing going on in Christ's Church.
I have been brought into His *flock* and there are many, many sheep here---we call it *the communion of saints* who share Christ's forgiveness won for each of us on the Cross.
We call it *the communion of saints*, *[Point to the altar.]* where our Lord feeds us His true body and blood at at His table.
Holy Communion is a meal where we all eat together, and, as Saint Paul says, **"Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread"** [(1Co 10:17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10/).
The heavenly reality of Holy Communion is not that we are many individuals participating, but that we come in as individual grains of wheat and become one loaf.
At Holy Communion, we all participate in Christ's body and become a *single loaf*, where the grains have been ground into flour and baked and when you look at the loaf, you cannot tell the difference between the grains anymore---there is one *bread*---one body of Christ.
You cannot even tell the difference between Jesus and the people anymore---you might as well call us *Christians*---we are all one body of Christ and *that is all we are*---you cannot tell the individuals apart anymore.

This is what God's Word teaches about the communion of saints, and today we observe All Saints Day.
Who am I when considered with all the saints?
Only a grain of wheat that has been ground up and baked into a loaf---the body of Christ.
It is as true as I partake of Holy Communion.
Who am I when considered with all the saints?
Only another sheep in Christ's well-cared-for flock.
And we are all *blessed* indeed---God's favor and protection are upon us.

Now amongst the sheep, there are also *peacemakers*.

> **Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.**

On the one had, there are peacemakers who, when they are involved in a volatile situation, will not be the ones to start a fight---they, by their very presence, keep the fight from starting in the first place.
But there are also peacemakers who get involved when the fight has already broken out.
Our veterans are *both*---they are both the peacemakers who keep the fight from starting and they get involved for our protection when the fight does break out.
I have never in my life witnessed war. My parents did. My grandparents did.
I have the veterans of the United States armed forces to thank for this.
Had not they been involved in World War II, it may be that my parents would not have lived to adulthood and I would have never been born.
Had not they been involved in Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East, I would not have lived in peace here in the United States every day of my life up to this day.
Blessed are the peacemakers---blessed are our veterans---who, by faith in Christ have peace with God and serve as peacemakers in this world.
Dear God, heavenly Father, bless them and their families and keep them close to you, though Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord.

AMEN.
