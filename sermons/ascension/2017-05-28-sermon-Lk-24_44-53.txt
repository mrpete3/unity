## Old Testament [Ac 1:1‑11 ESV]

[1] In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, [2] until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. [3] He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

[4] And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me; [5] for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”

[6] So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” [7] He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. [8] But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” [9] And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. [10] And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, [11] and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”

## Epistle [Eph 1:15‑23 ESV]

[15] For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, [16] I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, [17] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, [18] having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, [19] and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might [20] that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, [21] far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. [22] And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, [23] which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 24:44‑53 ESV; sermon text]

[44] Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” [45] Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, [46] and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, [47] and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. [48] You are witnesses of these things. [49] And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”

[50] And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. [51] While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. [52] And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, [53] and were continually in the temple blessing God.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, once again in our Holy Gospel we hear Christ testify of the Scriptures---we hear Christ point to the Scriptures and say that they testify of Him; this He *emphasizes* during the forty days of His Resurrection appearance.
Today's testimony is right at the end of Luke's Gospel, just before our Lord's Ascension into heaven.

> **"These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in _the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms_ must be fulfilled."**

This is is also the way our Lord Jesus taught Cleopas and the other disciple, as you remember, on the road to Emmaus: **Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to [Cleopas and the other disciple] in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself** (Lk 24:27 ESV).

In our Holy Gospel, right after pointing the disciples again to the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms, our Lord Jesus instructs them to wait in Jerusalem.

> **“Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that _repentance for the forgiveness of sins_ should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, _I am sending the promise of my Father upon you_. But stay in the city until you are _clothed with power from on high_.”**

In other words, "There's more. You *will* be witnesses of My death and Resurrection which proclaim to all mankind **repentance for the forgiveness of sins**, but **I am sending the promise of my Father upon you** as well.
**Stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high**."
What's more, beloved in the Lord, is that repentance for the forgiveness of sins in the name of Jesus is the main thing, as you know and believe, but wait till you receive the promise of the Father---wait till you are clothed with power from on high---wait till the Holy Spirit is poured out on you.

> **And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.**

Christ ascended into heaven in a cloud.
What are we to say?
What are we to believe?
Remember, though, the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms.
And for today, let us stick with the Psalms: what do they teach us of Christ's Ascension?

Our Introit today is from Psalm 110:

> **The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand,**\
> **until I make your enemies your footstool."** (Ps 110:1 ESV)

Psalm 110 teaches us that Jesus *ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty*.
When is the last time you ever used a footstool?
When you sit in a chair that is too high, you need to rest your feet on something higher than the ground---you rest your feet on a footstool.
I do not know much about thrones, but I imagine it is normal for a king who sits on a throne to rest his feet on a footstool.
That is what has become of Christ's enemies.
Christ's Resurrection and Ascension signals that our Lord is victorious and righteous over His enemies.
These enemies are no longer any threat to Him---they render humble service to Him as His footstool.

Again, with regard to Christ's Ascension, we turn to another psalm, Psalm 68:

> **You ascended on high,**\
> **leading a host of captives in your train**\
> **and receiving gifts among men,**\
> **even among the rebellious,**\
> **that the LORD God may dwell there.** (Ps 68:18 ESV)

Beloved, in the LORD, when it comes to celebrating Christ's Ascension, remember who you once were: a captive to sin, a captive to death.
Christ's train does not run on rails: His train is the royal train, the royal robe worn by the King that is so long that it drags along the ground.
Christ's Ascension places us---you and me---who were once captives of the devil and rebelling against God---following our King Jesus into heaven.

Beloved in the Lord, here is something to remember: who you were and where you were going to now, you are following Christ to heaven as holy child of God!
You were once captive to **philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ** (Col 2:8 ESV).
And in what direction were you once headed when you were a captive of the devil?
To hell---it is a terrible thing to say---to hell, where the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched (Mk 9:48).
Just ask the rich man who had no mercy on poor Lazarus where he was headed (Lk 16:23).
He begged Abraham to send Lazarus from the dead to warn his brothers so they would not wind up with him in constand thirst and torment.
What did Abraham tell the rich man?
**"They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them. ... If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead"** (Lk 16:29, 31).

> **and receiving gifts among men,**\
> **even among the rebellious,**\
> **that the LORD God may dwell there.**

AMEN.
