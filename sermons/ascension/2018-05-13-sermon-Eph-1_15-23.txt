## During the service

*Please include the following two prayers in your general prayers:
* Prayer for garden out front : As all the earth is a garden, Lord, we ask that you bless this small piece of the earth that we have prepared in the front of our church.  As Your Light shines upon us and upon this garden, giving us life, likewise help us to give light and life to others.  We pray you, Lord, to bless our garden. We ask you, Lord, to bless the water that will nourish this garden.  Help the roots of our plants tap into life-giving water.  Help us to always be rooted in your love and in the water of the Holy Spirit. (from https://www.episcopalrelief.org/uploaded/files/Church-In-Action/Children/Abundant-Life-Garden-Project/Blessing-of-a-Garden.pdf)

* Prayer for mothers (taken from the LCMS website): “Blessed Father, You grant us life through our parents and You set children in families. Be pleased to bless our mothers, especially on this Mothers’ Day. Help them recognize the holy office You have entrusted to them, and strengthen them to serve faithfully and well within it. Grant that their motherly service may not be burdensome, but rather joyful and glad. Bless all women who do not have children and those whose children are estranged from them, that their hope and confidence may ever remain in You in whom true joy is found. Give us loving hearts that freely give thanks for our mothers, that heartily forgive them where they have failed and fallen short, that willingly obey them, and that gladly honor them. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.”

## Announcements

* Happy Mother's Day
* Be sure to take a look outside before going down for coffee. Many hours have gone into removing unwanted growth and preparing the soil for a sustainable garden.

## First reading [Ac 1:1-11 ESV]

[1:1] In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, [2] until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
[3] He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
[4] And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me;
[5] for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”
[6] So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”
[7] He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. [8] But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses
in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” [9] And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
[10] And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, [11] and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven,
will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”


## Epistle [Eph. 1:15‑23 ESV; sermon text]

Ephesians 1:15-23
[15] For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, [16] I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,
[17] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, [18] having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you,
what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, [19] and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might [20] that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and
seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, [21] far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. [22] And he put all things under his feet and gave him
as head over all things to the church, [23] which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 24:44-53 ESV]

[44] Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”
[45] Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, [46] and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, [47] and that repentance and
forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. [48] You are witnesses of these things. [49] And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the
city until you are clothed with power from on high.”
[50] Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. [51] While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. [52] And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
[53] and were continually in the temple blessing God. 

## Introit [Ps 110:1, 4-5; antiphon: Ps 47:5]
