## Old Testament [Ne 8:1‑12 ESV]

[1]  And all the people gathered as one man into the square before the Water Gate. And they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses that the Lord had commanded Israel. 
[2]  So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could understand what they heard, on the first day of the seventh month. 
[3]  And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law. 
[4]  And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand, and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left hand. 
[5]  And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people, and as he opened it all the people stood. 
[6]  And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground. 
[7]  Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law, while the people remained in their places. 
[8]  They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading. 

[9]  And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the Lord your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept as they heard the words of the Law. 
[10]  Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready, for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” 
[11]  So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved.” 
[12]  And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.

## Epistle [1Ti 6:11b‑16 ESV]

[11b] Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. 
[12]  Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
[13]  I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before[d] Pontius Pilate made the good confession, 
[14]  to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
[15]  which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 
[16]  who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 10:26‑33 ESV; sermon text]

[26]  "So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. 
[27]  What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. 
[28]  And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.[h] 
[29]  Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?[i] And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. 
[30]  But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 
[31]  Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. 
[32]  So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, 
[33]  but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven."

[26] Μὴ οὖν φοβηθῆτε αὐτούς: οὐδὲν γάρ ἐστιν κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται. 
[27] ὃ λέγω ὑμῖν ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ, εἴπατε ἐν τῷ φωτί: καὶ ὃ εἰς τὸ οὖς ἀκούετε, κηρύξατε ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων. 
[28] καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων τὸ σῶμα, τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν μὴ δυναμένων ἀποκτεῖναι: φοβεῖσθε δὲ μᾶλλον τὸν δυνάμενον καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα ἀπολέσαι ἐν γεέννῃ. 
[29] οὐχὶ δύο στρουθία ἀσσαρίου πωλεῖται; καὶ ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐ πεσεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἄνευ τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν. 
[30] ὑμῶν δὲ καὶ αἱ τρίχες τῆς κεφαλῆς πᾶσαι ἠριθμημέναι εἰσίν. 
[31] μὴ οὖν φοβεῖσθε: πολλῶν στρουθίων διαφέρετε ὑμεῖς. 
[32] Πᾶς οὖν ὅστις ὁμολογήσει ἐν ἐμοὶ ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὁμολογήσω κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ πατρός μου τοῦ ἐν [τοῖς] οὐρανοῖς: 
[33] ὅστις δ' ἂν ἀρνήσηταί με ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἀρνήσομαι κἀγὼ αὐτὸν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ πατρός μου τοῦ ἐν [τοῖς] οὐρανοῖς.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, there are times when everything is okay; there are times when everything is great.
But then again there are times when everything is *not* okay---when everything is *not* great,
and you may be anxious.
Anxiety---being anxious because something is wrong---can eat at you.
Is it my fault?
Is it someone else's fault?
And what can I do to make it better?
I do not want to be anxious anymore.

In one way, the Reformation had to do with the anxiety of one Catholic monk: Martin Luther.
Luther was anxious because he knew he had sinned, if only in his mind, and he knew God was angry with him.
When you God is angry at you, something is definitely wrong.
Martin Luther was anxious because he wanted to be sure that God was not angry with him.
"I want to be sure God is not angry with me, so I'll become a monk!"
Imagine being in law school with a bright future ahead of you with good pay and giving it up to become a monk who lives in poverty.
That is what Luther did, thinking that God would no longer be angry with him.
He was studying to be a lawyer---and he would have made a nice living as a lawyer---and his father was happy that he was studying to be a lawyer---but *Martin Luther was really anxious about his sin* and anxious about his sin not being forgiven that he figured *he could do something to make sure his sins were forgiven*: he dropped out of law school and became a monk.
This has a lot to do with the Reformation.

But there is a word that goes along with anxiety: satisfaction.
Satisfaction, simply, is to be relieved of your anxiety;
Satisfaction means that what was wrong is now right and you have nothing to be stressed about anymore;
satisfaction means that your anxiety is gone.
*Anxiety* means that something is wrong; *satisfaction* means that everything is right---you are okay.

*Satisfaction* also has a concrete meaning when you go to confess your sins to a Catholic priest.
Martin Luther went to confession all the time.
Though he was a priest, *Luther's* father confessor, Johann von Staupitz, would hear Luther confess his sins, absolve him of his sins---that is, forgive his sins.
But then there was a third step, satisfaction, that remains in Roman Catholic practice to this day.
When Luther went to confession, he had to do the third step; when *anyone* went to confession in that day, he had to do the third step.
And to this very day, if you are Roman Catholic and you confess your sins to your priest, he will assign to you a third stop, called *satisfaction*: _do this and **then** you will be completely forgiven_.
"Say ten Hail Marys," for example.
The priest may tell you, "Say ten Hail Marys and then you will be completely forgiven."

Now at this point, beloved in the Lord, *at this point* the Reformation may have something to do with *everyone's* anxiety over sin.
And at this point I will now read to you Article IV of the Augsburg Confession.
There are 28 articles in the Augsburg Confession, but here is the heart of it, Article IV:

> Our churches teach that people cannot be justified before God by their own strength, merits, or works. People are freely justified for Christ's sake, through faith, when they believe that they are received into favor and that their sins are forgiven for Christ's sake. *By His death, Christ made satisfaction for our sins.* God counts this faith for righteousness in His sight.

In other words, though people continued to go to private confession, in the lands where the Augsburg Confession is believed, the priest will do the first step: hear the confession of sin.
He will do the second step: declare forgiveness in Christ's name.
But he will not assign the satisfaction to the penitent sinner because *by His death, Christ made satisfaction for our sins.*

And you need to look no further than Romans, chapter 3 to know that this is true.

> **But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, _whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood_, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.** [(Rm 3:21‑26 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3/)

Your just heard the word *propitiation* in Romans, chapter 3 and you heard the word *satisfaction* in Article IV of the Augsburg Confession.
*Satisfaction* is a technical term that those who went to confession would understand.
*Satisfaction* is that final step after your priest absolves you of what you have to do to *make sure* you are forgiven.
*Propitiation* is what Christ has done to *make sure* God is not angry with you anymore.
God literally directed His anger toward you for your sins *on His Son* Jesus, and killed Him on the Cross.
*Not once* did Jesus stop being the Father's only-begotten, beloved Son.
But Jesus took the blame for your sins and welcomed the opportunity to die for your sins so you could keep on living. Alleluia!
Good Friday, the greatest day in history, means that the Son has propitiated His Father and your Father in heaven.
Your Father in heaven is no longer angry with you.
Have *you* made satisfaction for your sins? No, not at all.
*Christ* has made *satisfaction* for your sins by His *propitiation* on the Cross.
That, beloved, in the Lord is the main teaching of the Bible.

| WHEN YOU BELIEVE HE DID IT ALL, IT IS DONE FOR YOU. |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

In other words, you are saved by faith alone---faith in Christ's proptitiation on the Cross for your sins.
When you believe that Jesus was punished on the Cross for sinners, it is done for you.
When you believe that Jesus destroyed hell's claim on sinners, it is done for you.
When you believe that Jesus rose from the dead to proclaim life for all who die from their sins, it is done for you.
This, we believe, is the confession of all of Christendom.

| WHEN YOU BELIEVE HE DID IT ALL, IT IS DONE FOR YOU. |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

May I then ask you, beloved in the Lord, what is there left for you to do to *make sure* that your sins have been satisfied?
Nothing.
Believe that when Jesus said on the Cross, **"It is finished,"** your sins were satisfied before God and you are most surely forgiven without a crumb left for you to pick up.
Christ has finished the job.
AMEN.
