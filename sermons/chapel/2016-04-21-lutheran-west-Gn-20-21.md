## Old Testament [Gn 20-21 ESV]

[1] From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. [2] And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. [3] But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.” [4] Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, “Lord, will you kill an innocent people? [5] Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.” [6] Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. [7] Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.”

[8] So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. [9] Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” [10] And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?” [11] Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ [12] Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. [13] And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”

[14] Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. [15] And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.” [16] To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.” [17] Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. [18] For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

[1] The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised. [2] And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. [3] Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. [4] And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. [5] Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. [6] And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.” [7] And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”

[8] And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. [9] But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing. [10] So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.” [11] And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. [12] But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. [13] And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.” [14] So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

[15] When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes. [16] Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, “Let me not look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. [17] And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. [18] Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” [19] Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. [20] And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow. [21] He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.

[22] At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. [23] Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.” [24] And Abraham said, “I will swear.”

[25] When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized, [26] Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.” [27] So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. [28] Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. [29] And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?” [30] He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” [31] Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath. [32] So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines. [33] Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. [34] And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, sin happens—sometimes small, sometimes big.
Let us turn our attention to Abraham and Sarah in the book of Genesis.
You may remember that Ishmael was born *not* to Abraham and Sarah, as God had promised, but to Abraham and *Hagar*.
Hagar was not Abraham's wife—she was his concubine—today we call it “living together.”
Sarah had doubted what God had promised—that *she* would have a child.
She doubted and gave Hagar to Abraham as a concubine so that Abraham could have the son that God had promised—that was Sarah's thinking fueled by doubt.
Sarah doubted—Abraham went along with it—and sin jumped in.

Now might be a fun time to make jokes about old people.
Abraham was 86 and Sarah was 76—older than maybe anyone in this room.
Imagine your grandparents thinking that God promised them they were going to have a baby!
But *you* are *young* people—what has God promised *you*?
Look around.
Lutheran West was built and your teachers have come here to teach you that *God has promised you the forgiveness of your sins in the name of Jesus Christ*, and to educate you in the context of that promise.
But if you doubt, sin jumps in.
It could be small, it could be big.

Going back to Abraham and what is recorded in Genesis, Sodom and Gomorrah was big—their sin was so big that God destroyed those cities with sulfur and fire.
I suppose it started with little sins against marriage—perhaps some doubted that marriage was for them and sought physical intimacy outside of marriage.
But by the time the cities were destroyed, all the men of the city were unrestrained homosexuals; and God destroyed them all.

And now, the next thing to happen, in Genesis, chapter 20, is that we come back to a smaller sin, but sin nonetheless.
This time Abraham doubts that God will protect his wife.
It is not from honor or wisdom that Abraham says to Abimelech, king of Gerar, **“She is my sister.”**
Sarah must be around 80 by now and good-looking.
She attracts Abimilech's attention just as years ago she had attracted Pharaoh's attention.
Abraham, remembering God's promise that Sarah would bear him a son, should have stood up and said proudly, “She is *my wife*,” knowing full well that God will keep them alive and give them their promised son.
But Abraham is a coward who has not learned well enough to trust God. (By the time He sacrifices Isaac, he will have learned.)
Abraham lies to protect his own life; instead, he should have protected his wife, and God would have still kept His promise.
**And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah**, but fortunately God warned Abimelech to stay away from her and she was returned to her huband.

Beloved in the Lord, you can take comfort in that Abraham was a sinner just like you.
And it should be of great comfort to you that elsewhere in the Bible,
Abraham is praised for his faith and even when our Lord Jesus talks about poor Lazarus going to heaven, He calls heaven “Abraham's side” [(Lk 16:22)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2016%3A22/).
*Abraham is the one* who comforts poor Lazarus in heaven and tells the rich man in hell that his five brothers left on earth better hear the Bible or they will wind up in hell, too.

In the end, Isaac is born to Abraham and Sarah, just as God had promised.
By then, Abraham and Sarah are as old as your *great*-grandparents.
But it happened, just as God had promised.
And to Isaac was born Jacob, and to Jacob were born the twelve tribes of Israel, and to the tribe of Judah is born none other than Jesus, the Son of God, our Savior from sin, just as God had promised.

Do not doubt what God has promised you in the name of Jesus. AMEN.

## Prayer

Gracious Father, you are merciful to your children and have redeemed us from sin and Satan through Your Son, Jesus.
Receive our thanks for Him and grant us unwavering faith, grant us Your Holy Spirit to trust all that you have promised and to turn our hearts toward them at all times;
through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.
