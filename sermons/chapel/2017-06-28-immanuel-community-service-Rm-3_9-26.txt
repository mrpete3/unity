## Holy Gospel [Rm 3:9‑26 ESV; sermon text]

[9] What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, [10] as it is written:

> “None is righteous, no, not one; [11] no one understands; no one seeks for God.\
> [12] All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”\
> [13] “Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.”\
> “The venom of asps is under their lips.”\
> [14] “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”\
> [15] “Their feet are swift to shed blood; [16] in their paths are ruin and misery,\
> [17] and the way of peace they have not known.”\
> [18] “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”

[19] Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. [20] For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

[21] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—[22] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we should pay close attention to the Bible, for it is God's Word.
Here is some of God's Word that I just read to you:

> **“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God.**\
> **All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”**

In our hymn this morning, we sang it like this:

> *What God did in His Law demand*\
> *And none to Him could render*

God's Law is His Ten Commandments.
It starts off with this: **You shall have no other gods.**
If I worship money, if I worship Ishtar, if I worship man's intelligence, I have a god, but it is not the *one true God*: it is not Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
That is how God's Law starts off: Do not worship an idol.

God's Law also tells me not to steal.
God forbid any of you would ever steal, but you know how I have probably stolen the most?
By being lazy---by not doing my best.
Someone paid me to work for an hour, but I worked for only 55 minutes.
Someone paid me to take care for someone, but I left them alone and snuck off and checked my phone.

God's Law would have me love my neighbor as myself.
**"Nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known"** (Mt 10:26).
God sees it all! God can see through all of my actions: He knows very well that I have loved myself the most.
How have I done by the Ten Commandments?
How have I done by God's Law?
I, Pastor Pirn, have failed!

> **“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God.**\
> **All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”**

And that includes me.

Beloved in the Lord, if that were all the Bible said, I might as well die in despair and go to hell.
God's Law is one message of the Bible---it is the truth, but it terrifies me.

However, the greater message of the Bible is *the Gospel*.

> *Yet as the Law must be fulfilled*\
> *Or we must die despairing,*\
> *Christ came and hath God's anger stilled,*\
> *Our human nature sharing.*\
> *He hath for us the Law obeyed*\
> *And thus the Father's vengeance stayed*\
> *Which over us impended.*

The Gospel is that whatever trouble I was in by God's Law, *Jesus Christ* dealt with it.
By God's Law, I should be punished for my sins; God's Law was fulfilled on Good Friday when Christ was crucified *in my place for my sins*.
The Law has been fulfilled: God's anger over His Commandments was directed at *His Son Jesus*, not me.
Beloved in the Lord, God's anger was directed at *His Son Jesus*, not you.

Believe it, and you are free from the Law.
That's right, all those sins---even the sins you hide away---Jesus handled *all of them*---He directed His Father's anger away from you and onto Himself and it killed Him.
Believe it---believe that out of His love for His Father and for you He did it---and your heavenly Father is no longer angry at you.
Did you hear that word---*propitiation*?
**God put [His Son] forward as a _propitiation_ by his blood, to be received by faith.**
Think of *propitiation* as turning on the light switch.
When the switch is off, you are worthless to God because of your idolatry.
But when Christ *propitiated* His Father by His blood shed on the Cross---when Christ propitiated His Father, He turned the switch on and now you are God's favorite child---all of you.
You were once worthless, but you are now God's favorite child.

| WHEN YOU BELIEVE JESUS DID IT ALL, IT IS DONE FOR YOU. |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

In other words, you are saved by faith alone---*faith in Christ's proptitiation on the Cross for your sins*.
When you believe that Jesus was punished on the Cross for sinners, it is done for you.
When you believe that Jesus destroyed hell's claim on sinners, it is done for you.
When you believe that Jesus rose from the dead to proclaim life for all who die from their sins, it is done for you.
AMEN.
