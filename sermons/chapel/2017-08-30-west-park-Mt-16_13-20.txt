## Reading [Mt 16:13‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[13] Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” [14] And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” [15] He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” [16] Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” [17] And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. [18] And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. [19] I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” [20] Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.

## Message

Dear children and teachers, Jesus asked His disciples, **“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”**
Do you know who the Son of Man is? ...
The Son of Man is a name for Jesus!
Jesus is a man and the name *Son of Man* means that He is the greatest of all men.
Jesus asked His disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"

> **And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”**

The people said that Jesus was a prophet that spoke God's Word.
There have been many prophets---Jeremiah, Elijah, and John the Baptist, for example---and the people said that Jesus was another one of those prophets.
It would be an honor to be called a prophet.

But, dear children, Jesus is not just a prophet!
Jesus again asked His disciples, **“But who do _you_ say that I am?”**
And Simon Peter answered,

|       "YOU ARE THE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD."         |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

Jesus is the Christ that the prophets talk about.
One of those prophets is David, who wrote Psalm 2[^1] that we read in chapel today:

> **Why do the nations rage**\
> **and the peoples plot in vain?**\
> **The kings of the earth set themselves,**\
> **and the rulers take counsel together,**\
> **against the LORD and against his _Anointed_, saying,**\
> **“Let us burst their bonds apart**\
> **and cast away their cords from us.”**

[^1]: Ac 4:25 teaches us that David wrote this psalm.

The word *Anointed* speaks about someone special who is God's Son.
The word *Anointed* means someone put oil on Him.
Would any of you like to be anointed? ...
God did not command me to anoint a student to be exemplary in completing his homework,
but it is God's will that they listen to their parents and teachers and do all the work that
has been assigned to them.
I wish to anoint a student to do God's good and gracious will.
*[Anoint student(s) to be exemplary in obeying their parents and teachers and doing their homework.]*

Jesus is the Son of God. *[The Father calls Him His Son at His Baptism.]*

Jesus is the Son of the *living* God. *[All other gods are dead.]*

AMEN.

## Prayers for others and for ourselves

Almighty God, whom to know is everlasting life, grant us to know Your Son, Jesus, to be the way, the truth, and the life that we may boldly confess Him to be the Christ and steadfastly walk in the way that leads to life eternal.

And we know, dear God, heavenly Father, that you created the sea and the dry land, the sun and the moon and the stars, and every living thing.
Please let dry land appear again to the people who are flooded in Texas and Louisiana and be their Helper in their time of need.
Bless, we pray, all the helpers who are there to help others in need.
And we thank You, gracious Father, for every day of good weather that we have.
Thank you that we are able to carry on with our lives normally today; may all that we do on this beautiful day be pleasing in Your sight.

And finally, dear God, heavenly Father, we know that You are the source of all wisdom and that You gave us Your Son who spoke the words that You gave Him and did only what You told Him to do.
We thank You eternally that You told Him to suffer in our place on the Cross and win the forgiveness of our sins.
Please bless us to do the little things You tell us to do and for the students to listen to their parents and teachers.
According to Your good and gracious will bless our students with eagerness and promptness to complete the assignments that they are given to do as part of their study in Your schoool; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
