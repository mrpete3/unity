## Epistle [Heb 1:1‑12 ESV]

[1] Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, [2] but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. [3] He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, [4] having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.

[5] For to which of the angels did God ever say,

> “You are my Son,\
> today I have begotten you”?


Or again,

> “I will be to him a father,\
> and he shall be to me a son”?


[6] And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,

> “Let all God's angels worship him.”


[7] Of the angels he says,

> “He makes his angels winds,\
> and his ministers a flame of fire.”


[8] But of the Son he says,

> “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,\
> the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.\
> [9] You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;\
> therefore God, your God, has anointed you\
> with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”


[10] And,

> “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,\
> and the heavens are the work of your hands;\
> [11] they will perish, but you remain;\
> they will all wear out like a garment,\
> [12] like a robe you will roll them up,\
> like a garment they will be changed.\
> But you are the same,\
> and your years will have no end.”

## Holy Gospel [Jn 1:1‑18 ESV; sermon text]

[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] He was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. [4] In him was life, and the life was the light of men. [5] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

[6] There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. [7] He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. [8] He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

[9] The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 
[10] He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.
[11] He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.
[12] But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, [13] who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

[14] And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[15] (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) [16] For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. [17] For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. [18] No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, Merry Christmas! Here in Old Brooklyn we take pride in putting out Christmas lights and I suspect that people drive here from out of the neighborhood to see them.
Hopefully the lights remind us that “Jesus is the reason for the season.”
This phrase is repeated often enough that even if a person never steps foot in a church for Christmas, these words will still be in the back of his mind: “Jesus is the reason for the season.”

If there were one verse that stands behind “Jesus is the reason for the season,” it is this one:

> **And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.**

The awe of Christmas is that the Christ Child, baby Jesus, is the Word made flesh who dwells among us.
We sang about it in the sermon hymn:

> *Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,*\
> *Born this happy morning;*\
> *Jesus to Thee be glory giv'n!*\
> **_Word of the Father_**\
> **_Now in flesh appearing!_**\
> *O come, let us adore Him, ...*

*Word of the Father* points back to the very beginning of the Bible, to the beginning of creation.

> **In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.**\
> **And God _said_, “Let there be light,” and there was light.**\
> **And God _said_, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”**\
> **And God _said_, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.** [(Gn 1:3, 6, 9 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%201%3A1/)

Whatever God said at creation, it was so.
And you may have noticed that John's Gospel begins like Genesis:

> **In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.** [(Jn 1:1‑3 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/John%201%3A1-3/)

John's Gospel starts like this on purpose: so that you would know, beloved in the Lord, that when God speaks in creation, **“Let there be light,”** the Word of God is a *person*.
The mystery of the Trinity defies human reason: the Word of God is a person; the Word of God is the Son of God.
We understand speech this way: our mouth moves and with the help of our vocal cords and the shape and movement of our mouth and lips, words are formed and come out for others to hear.
But when God speaks in creation, *His Word is a person* and we call this person *the Word*.

At Christmas, the reason for the season is that we are in joyful awe that **the Word became flesh**: baby Jesus is the *Word of the Father now in flesh appearing*.

Yet the Word, who created the world---the Word, who amazingly entered His mother Mary's womb and became a man---He became one of us to save us from our sins---**[the Word] was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.**
Take, for example, the situation of His birth.

> **[Mary] gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.** [(Lk 2:7 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%202%3A7/)

Can't the innkeeper, can't *anyone* see that the poor girl is pregnant and could use a little help?
Nothing.
“You can stay in the stable. And if you give birth tonight, it's on you.”
No midwife, no accomodations that a pregnant mother would normally receive.
Jesus enters the world despised by the world with no place but a stable in which to be born.
He is *Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing*; He is adored by Joseph and Mary, yet sheep are baaing cows are mooing right next to them.

> *The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,*\
> *But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes.* (LSB 364)

Beloved in the Lord, note this well.
Jesus is not received for who He is by the world.
He is not honored when He is born; He is despised when He dies bearing our sins.
By the grace of God and only by the grace of God you and I honor Him.
By the grace of God and only by the grace of God you and I believe in Him as our Savior from sin.
But we are not of this world---we have been called out of the darkness to His marvelous light---we have been called out of this world by the Babe of Bethlehem.
Yes, out of this world and into Christ's kingdom!

> *Hark! the herald angels sing.*\
> *Glory to the newborn King!*

When you continue in John's Gospel to chapter 3, you find out *why* the world despises Jesus.
And note this well.

> **And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.** [(Jn 3:19‑20 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/John%203%3A19-20/)

When God is born as a man, you better believe He is the light of the world.
The only problem is our darkness.
At some time, your deeds were done in darkness; whenever you sin, they still are.
If you feel like you would rather flee from Jesus, it is because His light shines and reveals something for which you are ashamed before God.
The Babe of Bethlehem is forceful.
He does not walk in a room and leave things the same---He cleans every corner.
He does not enter your heart by faith and leave it the same---He uncovers every sin and scrubs it away.
Welcome Him as your King and let Him do His job,
and rejoice that He is yours. AMEN.
