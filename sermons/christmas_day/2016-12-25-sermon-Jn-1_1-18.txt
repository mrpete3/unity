## Epistle [Heb 1:1‑12 ESV]

[1] Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, [2] but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. [3] He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, [4] having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.

[5] For to which of the angels did God ever say,

> “You are my Son,\
> today I have begotten you”?


Or again,

> “I will be to him a father,\
> and he shall be to me a son”?


[6] And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,

> “Let all God's angels worship him.”


[7] Of the angels he says,

> “He makes his angels winds,\
> and his ministers a flame of fire.”


[8] But of the Son he says,

> “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,\
> the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.\
> [9] You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;\
> therefore God, your God, has anointed you\
> with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”


[10] And,

> “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,\
> and the heavens are the work of your hands;\
> [11] they will perish, but you remain;\
> they will all wear out like a garment,\
> [12] like a robe you will roll them up,\
> like a garment they will be changed.\
> But you are the same,\
> and your years will have no end.”

## Holy Gospel [Jn 1:1‑18 ESV; sermon text]

[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] He was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. [4] In him was life, and the life was the light of men. [5] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

[6] There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. [7] He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. [8] He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

[9] The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. [10] He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. [11] He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. [12] But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, [13] who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

[14] And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. [15] (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) [16] For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. [17] For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. [18] No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.
