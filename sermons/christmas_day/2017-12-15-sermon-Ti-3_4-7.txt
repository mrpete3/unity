## Old Testament [Is 62:10‑12 ESV]

> [10] Go through, go through the gates;\
> prepare the way for the people;\
> build up, build up the highway;\
> clear it of stones;\
> lift up a signal over the peoples.\
> [11] Behold, the LORD has proclaimed\
> to the end of the earth:\
> Say to the daughter of Zion,\
> “Behold, your salvation comes;\
> behold, his reward is with him,\
> and his recompense before him.”\
> [12] And they shall be called The Holy People,\
> The Redeemed of the LORD;\
> and you shall be called Sought Out,\
> A City Not Forsaken.

## Epistle [Ti 3:4‑7 ESV; sermon text]

[4] But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, [5] he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, [6] whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, [7] so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

[4] ὅτε δὲ ἡ χρηστότης καὶ ἡ φιλανθρωπία ἐπεφάνη τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν θεοῦ, 
[5] οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων τῶν ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ ἃ ἐποιήσαμεν ἡμεῖς ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος ἔσωσεν ἡμᾶς διὰ λουτροῦ παλιγγενεσίας καὶ ἀνακαινώσεως πνεύματος ἁγίου, 
[6] οὗ ἐξέχεεν ἐφ' ἡμᾶς πλουσίως διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, 
[7] ἵνα δικαιωθέντες τῇ ἐκείνου χάριτι κληρονόμοι γενηθῶμεν κατ' ἐλπίδα ζωῆς αἰωνίου.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 2:1‑20 ESV]

[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. [11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,

> [14] “Glory to God in the highest,\
> and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”
	
[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

## Collect

Most merciful God, You gave Your eternal Word to become incarnate of the pure Virgin. Grant Your people grace to put away fleshly lusts, that they may be ready for Your visitation; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
And Merry Christmas!
This Christmas morning we take note of where the world would have us look on the one hand and where God chooses to reveal Himself on the other hand.
This is not simply a point-of-interest sermon because this issue of where the devil wants us to look and where God directs us to look quickly gets *real* when we leave church and go out and live as light and salt in the world [(Mt 5:13‑16)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5/).
The devil loves to deceive us, of all people, because if he can deceive a Christian, there is less salt and more decay, less light and more darkness, and that is how he likes it.

So let this be known straight from the Bible:
**The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil** [(1Jn 3:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+3/).
He was born to beat the devil for us.
He beat the devil when the devil tempted Him and He did not sin.
He beat the devil when the devil had Him crucified, but He was crucified to pay for our sins and redeem us from the devil.
There you have the *reason for the season*,
If that does not put you in the Christmas spirit, then why do we sing *[Sing.]*:

> *God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay*\
> *Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day*\
> **_To save us all from Satan's power when we had gone astray_**\
> *O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy*\
> *O tidings of comfort and joy!*

One of the works of the devil is to get you to think something is important when it is not.
For example, the devil wants you to think that going into debt so you can buy Christmas presents is important, but it is not.
Think of all the attention the devil diverts toward shopping at this time of the year---it starts on Black Friday and brings out the worst in us---you know it has to be from the devil.
Keep your mind on shopping and off of the Christ Child, who was born to destroy the devil.
If you are going to do anything exciting this Christmas season, it will involve shopping---that is what the devil wants you to believe.

A more subtle example is this: The devil wants you to believe that getting together with family is the most important thing about Christmas.
And if that does not put you in the Christmas spirit, I invite you again to please stay with me.
God made marriage and families---this is true---and family is good and family is important.
But where in the Bible does it teach us that getting together with family has anything to do with Christmas?
Even Joseph and Mary appear to be *away* from family for Christmas!
They are from Nazareth but are stranded in a stable in Bethlehem.
Joseph might have relatives in Bethlehem, but the kind with room for you to stay---they do not stay at a relative's house: they stay in a stable because there is **no place for them in the inn**.
(Funny what you find out about Christmas when you read the Bible.)
But why would the devil want Christmas to be all about getting together with family?
*Because a lot of people do not have family!*
Christmas is one of the most lonely times of the year for millions of people when the devil gets to tempt them to despair of their loneliness by pushing family, not the Christ Child, for Christmas.

There are others who cannot be with family for Christmas: the people who have to work.
Thank God that there is someone working in the nursing home today, away from family and caring for someone else's family.
Thank God that there is someone working in the hospital today, away from family and caring for someone else's family.
And you know who else is away from family for Christmas?
The shepherds: **"There were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."**
Instead of being home with family, the shepherds are outside taking care of sheep.
And to whom does God choose to reveal that His Son is born in Bethlehem?
To whom does the angel speak?
To whom do the heavenly host say,

> **"Glory to God in the highest,**\
> **and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!"**

To the shepherds!
Behold to whom and where God chooses to reveal Himself on Christmas: to working people who are away from family.
It is in the Bible.

Our Savior Jesus would grow up to teach us this about family:

> **They said to [Jesus], “Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you.” And he answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.”** [(Mk 3:32‑35 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+3/)

Beloved in the Lord, when you pray, **"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,"** you are Jesus' family. When He baptizes you, He makes you family by washing your sins away.
He is born so He can bear your sins and do that for you---wash you and make you clean.
There, He is born for you on Christmas Day to save you from the devil and to make you God's family and an heir of heaven.

> **When the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared [on Christmas Day], he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This is a trustworthy saying.** (Ti 3:4‑8)

AMEN.

## Notes

Please take special care at this point to remember where the world would have us look on the one hand and where God chooses to reveal Himself on the other hand.
The most wonderful event in the history of man---okay, maybe the *third* most wonderful event behind Christ's Crucifixion and Resurrection---put all Christmas Day NBA together and it comes nowhere close to being as wonderful as the birth of our Savior from sin and Satan: the God-man Jesus Christ.
