## Epistle [Ti 2:11‑14 ESV]

[11] For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, [12] training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, [13] waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, [14] who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 2:1‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. [11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,

> [14] “Glory to God in the highest,\
> and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”

[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

## Notes

For every hero, he was once a baby.

There are some of you in the congregation tonight who have memories of the Great Depression.
There are perhaps quite a few who remember World War&nbsp;II.
The trouble our nation endured during those days surpasses anything I have ever experienced.
And then there were the places where battles were fought and were people were rounded up and shot just for who they were.
I have no memory of these---I just read about in books and watch it in videos.

But Isaiah speaks of the coming of Jesus in these terms:

> [4] For the yoke of his burden,\
> and the staff for his shoulder,\
> the rod of his oppressor,\
> you have broken as on the day of Midian.\
> [5] For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult\
> and every garment rolled in blood\
> will be burned as fuel for the fire.\
> [6] *For to us a child is born*       ,\
> to us a son is given;\
> and the government shall be upon his shoulder,\
> and his name shall be called\
> Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,\
> Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\
> [7] Of the increase of his government and of peace\
> there will be no end,\
> on the throne of David and over his kingdom,\
> to establish it and to uphold it\
> with justice and with righteousness\
> from this time forth and forevermore.\
> The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.

The zeal of the LORD causes baby Jesus to be born of the virgin Mary and be lying in a manger on this Christmas Eve.
It is God's zeal to destroy His enemies.
God does have an enemy, Satan, who has been a liar from the beginning.
Just as the lie in Genesis, chapter&nbsp;3 led to murder in Genesis, chapter&nbsp;4, Satan has propagated lies time and time again that has led to murder, bloodshed, and even war.
God forbid, but you and I have participated in those lies from time to time, convinced that it is better to trust in man than God.
