## Epistle [Ti 2:11‑14 ESV]

[11] For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, [12] training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, [13] waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, [14] who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 2:1‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
[11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
[12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,

> [14] “Glory to God in the highest,\
> and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”

[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

## 1st Reading [Gen 3:14-15 ESV]

[14] The Lord God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field;
on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

## 2nd Reading [Micah 5:2]

[2] But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.

## 3rd Reading [Isaiah 9:1-2, 6-7]

[1]  But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. [2] The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. [6]For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. [7]Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

## 4th Reading [Matthew 1:18-25]

[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
[23] “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
    and they shall call his name Immanuel”
(which means, God with us). [24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord,
“I was born for great things.”
It is tempting to look at myself as though I have a great destiny to fulfill, like being President or an entertainer or even a spiritual leader---the end result being that I am great and people look up to me.
In times of frustration, I am tempted to think that others, even Satan, are holding me back from my innate greatness.
I may turn to God, asking Him to remove the impediments and do something to show how great I am.
But beloved in the Lord, though God certainly does want what is best for us, let us look to the Christ Child lying in a manger and see who He is and who we really are, and for what purpose the Christ Child has been **born this day in the city of David**.

For God's own chosen people, the Old-Testament Jews, were destined for greatness.
After all, they were *God's chosen people*---they were put on this earth to do something.
You are well aware that Joseph, the son of Jacob, became a great man in Egypt.
He saved his father and his brothers from famine.
After a while, however, their descendants became slaves in Egypt.
Was this greatness?
No doubt that as slaves they did great things; this is attested by the fantastic monuments of Egypt.
But the Israelites were the slaves by whose sweat and blood these fantastic monuments were built.
If I say, “I was born for great things,” this is not what I had in mind.

The Israelites, you would hope---God's chosen people---would rise to greatness as God led them by Moses out of slavery through the wilderness to the Promised Land.
In the wilderness they were entrusted with God's holy Ten Commandments written on stone tablets for them to carry with them and say, “These Commandments are what we're all about”---God's own rules to live by so that they, God's chosen people, would be greater than all the other nations of the earth.
They were to be great by living according to God's Commandments while the other nations, like the Egyptians, the Moabites, and the Amorites would worship their own foreign and false gods and live by unjust laws that they had invented for themselves.

This potential for greatness---for the Israelites themselves acknowledged that God had chosen them---this potential to be great by listening to God---by trusting God's plain Word more than their own opinions and imaginations---to live according to His holy Word---this potential for greatness *was sadly never realized*---it never happened.
It may have reached a high point during the reign of King Solomon, but then even he fell into idolatry (1Ki 11:3‑5).
And sadly, your potential for greatness before God has also never been realized, and it is your own fault.
If you think you are born for great things, then let me ask you this:
*Are you a father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, or worker? (You have certainly been born to be one of these.) Have you been disobedient, unfaithful, or lazy? Have you been hot-tempered, rude or quarrelsome? Have you hurt someone by your words or deeds? Have you stolen, been negligent, wasted anything, or done any harm?*
If so, you are *not* great before God---you have sinned against Him.

Back in the wilderness, the only reason God did not destroy the Israelites for sinning was that Moses pleaded with God not to kill them.
The LORD relented from killing all of His rebellious, chosen people in the wilderness that day only to keep His promise to take them to the Promised Land and to save His own honor before the nations [(Nm 14:15‑16 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Numbers%2014%3A15-16/).
For the time would come for God to show to *all nations* that He is not only the Savior of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.
And that time is *now*:

> **For unto _you_ is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.**

This causes great offense to Satan, who would rather have you continue in your sin to achieve not your greatness, but your own destruction.
If you are destined for greatness, Satan will have to have no part in it.
If you are destined for greatness, it is only by God taking away your sin.
If you are destined for greatness, God will have to do it for you, for you are unable.
If you are destined for greatness, it is only by the birth of the Christ Child this holy night!
He is born this night to take away your sin.
Make no mistake about who this child is: He is *Christ the Lord*, and by *Lord* I mean that the Christ Child baby Jesus is *God Himself*.
Contrary to what the Jehovah's Witnesses will tell you if you give them a chance, *Jesus **is** Jehovah*---*Jesus **is** God*.
St Paul writes in Titus, chapter 2,

> **For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, ... [We are] waiting for our blessed hope, the [second] appearing of the glory of _our great God and Savior Jesus Christ_.** [(Ti 2:11, 13 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Titus%202%3A11/)

As Christians, we confess that the Christ Child lying in the manger is God Himself---the Son of God begotten of the Father from eternity.
As Christians, we confess that the Christ Child lying in the manger is also true Man, born of the virgin Mary.
As Christians, we confess that the Christ Child lying in the manger was conceived without sin by the Holy Spirit to *bear our sin* on the Cross and by His death He will take our sins away and destroy even death itself.
Gabriel had told Mary and Joseph that His name is Jesus, which means *Savior*, because Jesus will save us from our sins.
This Christmas, we can only begin to wonder, with Mary and Joseph, how wonderful it is that God has not only sent us our Savior from sin, but that *Mary's baby boy* is our Savior---not an angel, not just a man, but the Christ Child---baby Jesus---both God and man.
Here He is, born as an infant like you and me, feeling cold and heat like you and me, nursing at His mother's breast like you and me.
He is great already.
*He is our greatness given to us*, yet He lies in a humble manger with cattle lowing nearby.
His greatness is not acknowledged by the world, but by God.

By the birth of this Child, the angels declare to the shepherds that God is now pleased with us.

> **“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those _with whom he is pleased_!”**

What changed His mind?
Is He pleased with for our innate greatness? No.
He is pleased with us because of who Jesus is---His beloved Son.
He is pleased with us because of what Jesus will do to save us from our sins.
If God would look at our sins, He would be angry.
But when He looks at His Son, He sees our sins *no more*---He sees His Son bearing our sins---He sees His Son's blood shed on the Cross to atone for our sins.
But where there is atonement for our sins, our Father in heaven sees our sins no more.
This is how Jesus is our greatness---not achieved by our own efforts but given to us as a gift!

Beloved in the Lord, *that* is the reason for the season.
Receive Jesus as your greatness and be glad and rejoice---express it by singing, express it by exchanging gifts---be glad and rejoice that such a Savior is born this night in Bethlehem.
Confess your sins and receive Him as your Savior from sin.
*Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!* AMEN.

## Outline (not used)

|       WE GOT INTO IT. JESUS WAS BORN TO GET US OUT OF IT.         |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

1. I was born to do great things.
    1. What great things have you done, really?
    1. What great things had Israel done to get to the Promised Land?
1. The Israelites worshiped the gods of the Amorites.
    1. God raised up Gideon
        1. We do not know anything about his birth.
        1. We do know that he was threshing wheat when the angel of the LORD appeared to him.
        1. He conquered the Midianites.
        1. Isaiah brings up the Midianites (Is 9:4). The Son to be born is Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
1. These are the names with which Jesus is born.
    1. But if the government is to be on His shoulder, which is Caesar Augustus not there, or even the mayor of Bethlehem. He sleeps in a manger!
        1. As an adult, He is disinterested in government. Mt 17:24‑27 Jesus pays His taxes by having Peter catch a fish and take a coin out of His mouth.
        1. Mt 22:21 Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.
        1. Jn 18:36 My kingdom is not of this world.
    1. Jesus' government is the heavenly kingdom.
        1. The angels proclaim, **“Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.”**
        1. Jesus' rule and government over you is as your Savior and King.
1. What great things have I done that a Savior has been born to me?
    1. I have gotten in trouble like the ancient Israelites. I have made idols and incurred God's wrath.
    1. He has come to save me and not establish me in an earthly kingdom, but in His heavenly kingdom.
    1. *Boundless shall Thy kingdom be; When shall we its glories see?*
    1. When we confess our idolatry and worship Him as our Savior from sin, His glory enters our heart like He entered Mary to give birth to the new Man.
    1. We will see His glory---contrary to all worldly glory---when bears our sins and is crucified for them.

## Notes

Lk 2:6. Did Mary experience pain when she have birth to her Son?

For every hero, he was once a baby.
In Judges, chapter 6, you may recall, the Israelites had gotten themselves into trouble.
But before I get any further into this Bible story and before I get into what I know you have all come to hear---that our Savior was born in Bethlehem long ago---consider what trouble have *you* gotten yourself into.
For the Israelites in the days of the Judges, they had simply done what God had warned them not to do: they has worshiped the gods of the Amorites.

There are some of you in the congregation tonight who have memories of the Great Depression.
There are perhaps quite a few who remember World War II.
The trouble our nation endured during those days surpasses anything I have ever experienced.
And then there were the places where battles were fought and were people were rounded up and shot just for who they were.
I have no memory of these---I just read about in books and watch it in videos.

But Isaiah speaks of the coming of Jesus in these terms:

> [4] For the yoke of his burden,\
> and the staff for his shoulder,\
> the rod of his oppressor,\
> you have broken as on the day of Midian.\
> [5] For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult\
> and every garment rolled in blood\
> will be burned as fuel for the fire.\
> [6] *For to us a child is born*       ,\
> to us a son is given;\
> and the government shall be upon his shoulder,\
> and his name shall be called\
> Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,\
> Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\
> [7] Of the increase of his government and of peace\
> there will be no end,\
> on the throne of David and over his kingdom,\
> to establish it and to uphold it\
> with justice and with righteousness\
> from this time forth and forevermore.\
> The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.

The zeal of the LORD causes baby Jesus to be born of the virgin Mary and be lying in a manger on this Christmas Eve.
It is God's zeal to destroy His enemies.
God does have an enemy, Satan, who has been a liar from the beginning.
Just as the lie in Genesis, chapter&nbsp;3 led to murder in Genesis, chapter&nbsp;4, Satan has propagated lies time and time again that has led to murder, bloodshed, and even war.
God forbid, but you and I have participated in those lies from time to time, convinced that it is better to trust in man than God.

The Jews, sadly, when God finally did lead them finally to the Promised Land,did not change their ways.
They *continued to worship the foreign gods* about which God had strictly warned them, “Have nothing to do with them!”
Any gods you may invent, or have presented to you who are not Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---the God of the Bible---have nothing to do with them!
They can only lead you to great shame and vice and ultimately to your eternal destruction.
From the ruination of the Garden of Eden, Satan continues to destroy all of God's good work among us by his deceitful ways, but helping us invent gods from which we seek all good and turn to in time of trouble---only to find that when the trouble comes, we have no help, we die and go to hell.
Then Satan feels that He has won and God has lost.
