## Epistle [Ti 2:11‑14 ESV]

[11] For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, [12] training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, [13] waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, [14] who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 2:1‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
[11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
[12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,

> [14] “Glory to God in the highest,\
> and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”

[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

## 1st Reading [Gen 3:14-15 ESV]

[14] The Lord God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field;
on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

## 2nd Reading [Micah 5:2]

[2] But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.

## 3rd Reading [Isaiah 9:1-2, 6-7]

[1]  But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. [2] The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. [6]For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. [7]Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

## 4th Reading [Matthew 1:18-25]

[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
[23] “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
    and they shall call his name Immanuel”
(which means, God with us). [24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord,
“I was born for great things.”
It is tempting to look at myself as though I have a great destiny to fulfill in my lifetime, like being President or an entertainer---the end result being that I am great and people look up to me.
In times of frustration, I may feel that others, even Satan, are holding me back from my innate greatness.
I may turn to God, asking Him to remove the impediments and do something to show how great I am.
But beloved in the Lord, though God certainly does want what is best for us, let us look to the Christ Child lying in a manger and see who He is and who we really are, and for what purpose the Christ Child has been **born this day in the city of David**.

For God's own chosen people, the Old-Testament Jews, were destined for greatness, you might think.
After all, they were *God's own chosen people*---they were put on this earth to do something.
You are well aware that during the days of Joseph, there was a famine in the land of Israel, and Jacob and his sons moved to Egypt, where God had made Jacob's son Joseph into a great man who fed them and kept them alive.
After a while, however, their descendants became slaves in the land of Egypt.
Was this greatness?
No doubt that as slaves they did many great things; this is attested by the fantastic monuments of Egypt.
But the Israelites were the slaves on whose backs these fantastic monuments were built.
If I say, “I was born for great things,” this is not what I had in mind.

The Israelites, you would hope---God's chosen people---would rise to greatness as God led them by Moses for forty years through the wilderness to the Promised Land.
God gave them His holy Ten Commandments in the wilderness---God's own rules to live by so that they, God's chosen people, would distinguish themselves from all the other nations of the earth and be great.
They were to be great by living according to God's Word while the other nations, like the Egyptians, the Moabites, and the Amorites would live according to their own false gods that they had invented for themselves.

This potential for greatness---for they themselves acknowledged that God had chosen them---this potential to be great by listening to God---by trusting God's plain Word more than their own opinions--- and living according to His holy Word *was sadly never realized*.
The only reason God did not destroy them for sinning against His Commandments was the appeal of Moses:

> **“Now if you[, O LORD,] kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will say, ‘It is because the LORD was _not able_ to bring this people into the land that he swore to give to them that he has killed them in the wilderness.’”** [(Nm 14:15‑16 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Numbers%2014%3A15-16/)

The LORD relented from killing all of his rebellious, chosen people in the wilderness that day only to save His own honor before the nations and to show to *all nations* that He is not only the Savior of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.
The Jews, sadly, when God finally did lead them finally to the Promised Land,did not change their ways.
They *continued to worship the foreign gods* about which God had strictly warned them, “Have nothing to do with them!”
Any gods you may invent, or have presented to you who are not Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---the God of the Bible---have nothing to do with them!
They can only lead you to great shame and vice and ultimately to your eternal destruction.
From the ruination of the Garden of Eden, Satan continues to destroy all of God's good work among us by his deceitful ways, but helping us invent gods from which we seek all good and turn to in time of trouble---only to find that when the trouble comes, we have no help, we die and go to hell.
Then Satan feels that He has won and God has lost.


> **For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.**

If you were destined for greatness, it is only by the birth of the Christ Child this holy night!



AMEN.

## Outline

|       WE GOT INTO IT. JESUS WAS BORN TO GET US OUT OF IT.         |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

1. I was born to do great things.
    1. What great things have you done, really?
    1. What great things had Israel done to get to the Promised Land?
1. The Israelites worshiped the gods of the Amorites.
    1. God raised up Gideon
        1. We do not know anything about his birth.
        1. We do know that he was threshing wheat when the angel of the LORD appeared to him.
        1. He conquered the Midianites.
        1. Isaiah brings up the Midianites (Is 9:4). The Son to be born is Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
1. These are the names with which Jesus is born.
    1. But if the government is to be on His shoulder, which is Caesar Augustus not there, or even the mayor of Bethlehem. He sleeps in a manger!
        1. As an adult, He is disinterested in government. Mt 17:24‑27 Jesus pays His taxes by having Peter catch a fish and take a coin out of His mouth.
        1. Mt 22:21 Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.
        1. Jn 18:36 My kingdom is not of this world.
    1. Jesus' government is the heavenly kingdom.
        1. The angels proclaim, **“Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.”**
        1. Jesus' rule and government over you is as your Savior and King.
1. What great things have I done that a Savior has been born to me?
    1. I have gotten in trouble like the ancient Israelites. I have made idols and incurred God's wrath.
    1. He has come to save me and not establish me in an earthly kingdom, but in His heavenly kingdom.
    1. *Boundless shall Thy kingdom be; When shall we its glories see?*
    1. When we confess our idolatry and worship Him as our Savior from sin, His glory enters our heart like He entered Mary to give birth to the new Man.
    1. We will see His glory---contrary to all worldly glory---when bears our sins and is crucified for them.

## Notes

Lk 2:6. Did Mary experience pain when she have birth to her Son?

For every hero, he was once a baby.
In Judges, chapter 6, you may recall, the Israelites had gotten themselves into trouble.
But before I get any further into this Bible story and before I get into what I know you have all come to hear---that our Savior was born in Bethlehem long ago---consider what trouble have *you* gotten yourself into.
For the Israelites in the days of the Judges, they had simply done what God had warned them not to do: they has worshiped the gods of the Amorites.

There are some of you in the congregation tonight who have memories of the Great Depression.
There are perhaps quite a few who remember World War II.
The trouble our nation endured during those days surpasses anything I have ever experienced.
And then there were the places where battles were fought and were people were rounded up and shot just for who they were.
I have no memory of these---I just read about in books and watch it in videos.

But Isaiah speaks of the coming of Jesus in these terms:

> [4] For the yoke of his burden,\
> and the staff for his shoulder,\
> the rod of his oppressor,\
> you have broken as on the day of Midian.\
> [5] For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult\
> and every garment rolled in blood\
> will be burned as fuel for the fire.\
> [6] *For to us a child is born*       ,\
> to us a son is given;\
> and the government shall be upon his shoulder,\
> and his name shall be called\
> Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,\
> Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\
> [7] Of the increase of his government and of peace\
> there will be no end,\
> on the throne of David and over his kingdom,\
> to establish it and to uphold it\
> with justice and with righteousness\
> from this time forth and forevermore.\
> The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.

The zeal of the LORD causes baby Jesus to be born of the virgin Mary and be lying in a manger on this Christmas Eve.
It is God's zeal to destroy His enemies.
God does have an enemy, Satan, who has been a liar from the beginning.
Just as the lie in Genesis, chapter&nbsp;3 led to murder in Genesis, chapter&nbsp;4, Satan has propagated lies time and time again that has led to murder, bloodshed, and even war.
God forbid, but you and I have participated in those lies from time to time, convinced that it is better to trust in man than God.
