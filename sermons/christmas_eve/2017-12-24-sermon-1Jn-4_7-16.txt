## First reading [Is 7:10‑14 ESV]

[10] Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz: [11] “Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” [12] But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.” [13] And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? [14] Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

## Epistle [1Jn 4:7‑16 ESV; sermon text]

[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

[13] By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. [14] And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. [15] Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. [16] So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.

[7] Ἀγαπητοί, ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἀγαπῶν ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ γεγέννηται καὶ γινώσκει τὸν θεόν. 
[8] ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν οὐκ ἔγνω τὸν θεόν, ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν. 
[9] ἐν τούτῳ ἐφανερώθη ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν, ὅτι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ ἀπέσταλκεν ὁ θεὸς εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἵνα ζήσωμεν δι' αὐτοῦ. 
[10] ἐν τούτῳ ἐστὶν ἡ ἀγάπη, οὐχ ὅτι ἡμεῖς ἠγαπήκαμεν τὸν θεόν, ἀλλ' ὅτι αὐτὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἱλασμὸν περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν. 
[11] Ἀγαπητοί, εἰ οὕτως ὁ θεὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἡμεῖς ὀφείλομεν ἀλλήλους ἀγαπᾶν. 
[12] θεὸν οὐδεὶς πώποτε τεθέαται: ἐὰν ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, ὁ θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν μένει καὶ ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν τετελειωμένη ἐστιν. 

[13] Ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ μένομεν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν ἡμῖν, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ δέδωκεν ἡμῖν. 
[14] καὶ ἡμεῖς τεθεάμεθα καὶ μαρτυροῦμεν ὅτι ὁ πατὴρ ἀπέσταλκεν τὸν υἱὸν σωτῆρα τοῦ κόσμου. 
[15] ὃς ἐὰν ὁμολογήσῃ ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, ὁ θεὸς ἐν αὐτῷ μένει καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ θεῷ. 
[16] καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐγνώκαμεν καὶ πεπιστεύκαμεν τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἔχει ὁ θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν. Ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν, καὶ ὁ μένων ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ ἐν τῷ θεῷ μένει καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἐν αὐτῷ μένει.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 1:18‑25 ESV; same as 4th reading]

## 1st Reading [Gen 3:14-15 ESV]

[14] The Lord God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field;
on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

* _TLH_ 95 _Savior of the Nations Come_ _st_ 1, 2
    
## 2nd Reading [Micah 5:2]

[2] But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.

* _TLH_ 647  _O Little Town of Bethlehem_ _st_ 1, 3

## 3rd Reading [Isaiah 9:1-2, 6-7]

[1]  But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. [2] The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. [6] For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. [7] Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. 

* _TLH_ 85 _From Heaven Above, to Earth I Come_ _st_ 13

## 4th Reading [Matthew 1:18-25]

[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:

> [23] “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,\
> and they shall call his name Immanuel”

(which means, God with us). [24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

* _TLH_ 645 _Behold a Branch is Growing_ _st_ 1, 2

## 5th Reading [Luke 2:1-7]

[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

* _TLH_ 94 _Hark the Herald Angels Sing_ _st_ 1, 3, 4

## 6th Reading [Luke 2:8-14]

[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. [11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”[13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
[14] “Glory to God in the highest,
    and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”
    
* _LW_ 55 _Angels We Have Heard on High_ _st_ 1, 2
    
##7th Reading [Luke 2:15-20]

[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
There is no end to trouble in the world.
Was there always this much trouble but now we only find out about it faster?
I do not know.
But there *is* trouble, and our Lord said the trouble would come.

> **"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains."** [(Mk 13:7‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+13/)

This is the Word of our Lord; trouble is upon us.
It may be that trouble is piling on us today, but there was certainly also trouble in the days of king Ahaz of Judah.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign in place of his father, Jotham, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. (There may be trouble brewing in Jerusalem now, but it sure was brewing back then in 735 B.C.)
Jerusalem at that time was surrounded by the Syrians *and* the Israelites of the northern kingdom---a two-kingdom coalition.
The northern king was Pekah, the son of Remaliah, and the Syrian king was Rezin.
The kingdom of Judah needed a good leader in the face of an allied threat, but Ahaz was hardly a good leader.

> **[Ahaz] walked in the way of the kings of Israel. _He even burned his son as an offering_, according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.** [(2Ki 16:3 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+16/)

Yet Ahaz also claimed to worship the God of Israel.
Claim what he may, Ahaz was an idolater; Ahaz was terrible.
Obviously, he had no regard for the God of Israel, for he burned is own son to death as an offering to an idol.

Do you know that the prophet Isaiah met Ahaz face-to-face?
Isaiah said flat out, **"Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah"** [(Is 7:4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+7/).

"You have nothing to be afraid of, Ahaz, the LORD is with you."

> **Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz: "Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven."** [(Is 7:10‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+7/)

If the prophet Isaiah stood before you and told you, "Ask the LORD for anything you want," what would *you* answer?
Ahaz answered,

> **"I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test."** 

With these words, Ahaz stands condemned. "No thank you, I'm good. *I don't need God to help me.*"

* *Don't need God to help me?* you, who burned your son in the fire?
* *Don't need God to help me?* you, who are surrounded by two armies?
* *Don't need God to help me?* you, who are tempted every day?
* *Don't need God to help me?* you, who gossip on Facebook?
* *Don't need God to help me?* you, who do not work but still want to be paid?

*Don't need God to help me?* Then you have no need to hear the name of *Jesus*, for *Jesus* means *Savior*.
To Ahaz---and to you, even if you should think like Ahaz---*I don't need God to help me.*---the prophet replies,

> **"The Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."**

which means **_God with us_**.
God's disposition toward you, who do not "need God," is "I'm coming anyway."
If you would just believe that **God is love**, here is how He loves you: push Him away, but He's comes anyway.

Have you ever been rejected and had to face those who rejected you?
How did you face them? Defiantly? Vindictively---"Now you'll be sorry"?
God forbid, violently?
God would be right to do the same to you, who have sinned and pushed God away.
But behold the manger in Bethlehem: *This is how God chooses to come to you*.
He comes to you in the baby Jesus, and *Jesus* means *Savior*; He is here to save you from your sins.

May the Christmas hymns bless you at this point.

> *Down in a lowly manger*\
> *The humble Christ was born;*\
> *And God sent us salvation*\
> *That blessed Christmas morn.*

And again,

> *Hark! the herald angels sing,*\
> *"Glory to the newborn King;*\
> *Peace on earth and mercy mild,*\
> *God and sinners reconciled!"*

Even if you would deny that you need God to save you from your sins,
even if you would deny that Satan has enslaved you by manipulating your flesh to serve him,
even if you would deny there is a hell,
God is neverthess with us---He has not gone away.
God is *here*.
Behold, the Christ Child, is more than a child: though He remains a child, He is also *God*---He is *God with us*.
Now ponder that and look at Christ in the manger.
Could not anyone have given our dear Lord and Savior Jesus a nice place to be born?
But He will be despised and rejected many times more, yet still He is with us.

AMEN.
