## First reading [Is 7:10‑14 ESV]

[10] Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz: [11] “Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” [12] But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.” [13] And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? [14] Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

## Epistle [1Jn 4:7‑16 ESV; sermon text]

[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

[13] By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. [14] And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. [15] Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. [16] So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.

[7] Ἀγαπητοί, ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἀγαπῶν ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ γεγέννηται καὶ γινώσκει τὸν θεόν. 
[8] ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν οὐκ ἔγνω τὸν θεόν, ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν. 
[9] ἐν τούτῳ ἐφανερώθη ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν, ὅτι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ ἀπέσταλκεν ὁ θεὸς εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἵνα ζήσωμεν δι' αὐτοῦ. 
[10] ἐν τούτῳ ἐστὶν ἡ ἀγάπη, οὐχ ὅτι ἡμεῖς ἠγαπήκαμεν τὸν θεόν, ἀλλ' ὅτι αὐτὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἱλασμὸν περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν. 
[11] Ἀγαπητοί, εἰ οὕτως ὁ θεὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἡμεῖς ὀφείλομεν ἀλλήλους ἀγαπᾶν. 
[12] θεὸν οὐδεὶς πώποτε τεθέαται: ἐὰν ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, ὁ θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν μένει καὶ ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν τετελειωμένη ἐστιν. 

[13] Ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ μένομεν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν ἡμῖν, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ δέδωκεν ἡμῖν. 
[14] καὶ ἡμεῖς τεθεάμεθα καὶ μαρτυροῦμεν ὅτι ὁ πατὴρ ἀπέσταλκεν τὸν υἱὸν σωτῆρα τοῦ κόσμου. 
[15] ὃς ἐὰν ὁμολογήσῃ ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, ὁ θεὸς ἐν αὐτῷ μένει καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ θεῷ. 
[16] καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐγνώκαμεν καὶ πεπιστεύκαμεν τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἔχει ὁ θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν. Ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν, καὶ ὁ μένων ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ ἐν τῷ θεῷ μένει καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἐν αὐτῷ μένει.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 1:18‑25 ESV; same as 4th reading]

## 1st Reading [Gen 3:14-15 ESV]

[14] The Lord God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field;
on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

* _TLH_ 95 _Savior of the Nations Come_ _st_ 1, 2
    
## 2nd Reading [Micah 5:2]

[2] But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.

* _TLH_ 647  _O Little Town of Bethlehem_ _st_ 1, 3

## 3rd Reading [Isaiah 9:1-2, 6-7]

[1]  But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. [2] The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. [6] For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. [7] Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. 

* _TLH_ 85 _From Heaven Above, to Earth I Come_ _st_ 13

## 4th Reading [Matthew 1:18-25]

[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:

> [23] “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,\
> and they shall call his name Immanuel”

(which means, God with us). [24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

* _TLH_ 645 _Behold a Branch is Growing_ _st_ 1, 2

## 5th Reading [Luke 2:1-7]

[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

* _TLH_ 94 _Hark the Herald Angels Sing_ _st_ 1, 3, 4

## 6th Reading [Luke 2:8-14]

[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. [11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”[13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
[14] “Glory to God in the highest,
    and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”
    
* _LW_ 55 _Angels We Have Heard on High_ _st_ 1, 2
    
##7th Reading [Luke 2:15-20]

[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
There is no end to trouble in the world.
Was there always this much trouble but now we only find out about it faster?
I do not know.
But there *is* trouble, and our Lord said the trouble would come [(Mk 13:7‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+13/).

Trouble may be piling on us today, but there was certainly also trouble in the days of king Ahaz of Judah.
He reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
(Again, there may be trouble brewing in Jerusalem now, but it sure was brewing back then in 735 B.C.)
Jerusalem at that time was surrounded by two enemy armies: the Syrians *and* the Israelites of the northern kingdom.
A two-kingdom coalition was set to attack and destroy Jerusalem.
Jerusalem was in big trouble; the kingdom of Judah needed a strong leader in the face of an allied threat, but Ahaz was weak in his faith in the God of Israel.

> **[Ahaz] walked in the way of the kings of Israel. _He even burned his son as an offering_, according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.** [(2Ki 16:3 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+16/)

Ahaz was an idolater---he burned his own son to death as an offering to and idol---yet he also professed to worship the God of Israel.
Yeah, right.
Claim what he may, Ahaz was an idolater; Ahaz was terrible.
He had no regard for the God of Israel.

But do you know that the prophet Isaiah spoke face-to-face with king Ahaz?
Oh, yes he did!
Isaiah said flat out to Ahaz, **"Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of [the king of Syria] and the [king of Israel]"** [(Is 7:4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+7/).

"You have nothing to be afraid of, Ahaz, the LORD is with you."

> **Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz: "Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven."** [(Is 7:10‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+7/)

**"Ask a sign of the LORD _your_ God,"** as if Ahaz really did trust the one true God who could help him.
Put yourself in Ahaz's shoes for a moment.
If the prophet Isaiah stood before you and told you, "Ask the LORD for anything you want," what would *you* answer?
Ahaz answered, **"I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test."** 

With these words, Ahaz stands condemned. "No thank you, I'm good. *I don't need God to help me.*"

* *Don't need God to help you?* you, who burned your son in the fire?
* *Don't need God to help you?* you, who are surrounded by two armies?
* *Don't need God to help you?* you, who are tempted every day, and whose thoughts smell of sin?
* *Don't need God to help you?* you, who gossip on Facebook?
* *Don't need God to help you?* you, who do not do your work but still want to be paid?

*Don't need God to help you* for all the trouble you cause by sinning?
Then you have no need to hear the name of *Jesus*, for *Jesus* means *Savior*.
To Ahaz---and to you, if you have the same attitude as Ahaz---*I don't need God to help me.*---the prophet replies,

> **"Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will _give_ you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name _Immanuel_,"**

which means **_God with us_**.
God's disposition toward you, who do not "need God," is "I'm getting tired of your attitude, but I'm coming anyway."
If you believe that **God is love**, _here is how He loves you_: _push Him away, but He comes anyway_.

Have you ever been rejected and had to face your rejecter?
How do you face him? Defiantly? Vindictively---"Now it's payback time"?
God forbid, do you face your rejecter violently?
God would be right to do the same to you, who have sinned and pushed God away.
But behold the manger in Bethlehem: *This is how God comes to you: meek, lowly, and vulnerable*.
You have hurt him before, but He does not come with protection so that you cannot hurt Him again---you *can* hurt Him again---He is *vulnerable*.
He comes to you as baby Jesus, and *Jesus* means *Savior*; He, believe it or not, comes to save you from your sins.

Beloved in the Lord, _push Him away, but He comes anyway_---He comes meek and lowly. Now sing the Christmas hymns and be blessed to have baby Jesus as your Savior from sin. 

> *Down in a lowly manger*\
> *The humble Christ was born;*\
> *And God sent us salvation*\
> *That blessed Christmas morn.*

And again,

> *Hark! the herald angels sing,*\
> *"Glory to the newborn King;*\
> *Peace on earth and mercy mild,*\
> *God and sinners reconciled!"*

Even if you would deny that you need God to save you from your sins,
even if you would deny that Satan has enslaved you to serve him,
even if you would deny there is a hell,
God is nevertheless *with you*---He is not far away.
God is *here with us*.
Behold, the Christ Child is more than a child: He is also *God*---**God with us**.
Ponder *that* and behold baby Jesus in the manger.
Could not have anyone given Him a nicer place to be born?
When He becomes a grown man, He will cast out the Legion of demons but be asked to *leave* the region of the Gerasenes (Mk 5:15‑17).
He will heal and forgive in some places (Mk 2:5, 9), but in His own hometown
they will take offense at Him.
He will remind them, **"A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household."** He will do no mighty work there, for lack of faith, except lay His hands on a few sick people and heal them [(Mk 6:4‑5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+6/).
He will ultimately be betrayed by one of His hand-picked apostles, denied by another, and abandoned by the rest.
_Push Him away, but He comes anyway_.
He keeps coming---He will not stop---until utterly rejected by men *while bearing their sin for them* on the Cross, and as the bearer of sin, utterly rejected also by His Father. **"My God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?"**
There, He will pay the price for all sin so that when He says, **"Your sins are forgiven,"** or when any Christian tell you, "Your sins are forgiven in the name of Jesus," you will know that though He was pushed away, He kept coming anyway until *your* sins were paid for in full.
Baby Jesus is born to love you.
AMEN.
