## Old Testament [Is 7:10‑14 ESV]

[10] Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz: [11] “Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” [12] But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.” [13] And he said, "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? [14] Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."

## Epistle [1Jn 4:7‑16 ESV]

[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

[13] By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. [14] And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. [15] Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. [16] So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 5:21‑37 ESV; same as 4th reading]

* _Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful*

## 1st Reading [Gen 3:14-15 ESV]

[14] The Lord God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field;
on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

* _TLH_ 95 _Savior of the Nations Come_ st 1, 2
    
## 2nd Reading [Micah 5:2]

[2] But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.

* _TLH_ 647  _O Little Town of Bethlehem_ st 1, 3

## 3rd Reading [Isaiah 9:1-2, 6-7; sermon text]

[1] But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. [2] The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.
[6] For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[7] Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. 

* _Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus_

## 4th Reading [Matthew 1:18-25]

[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:

> [23] “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,\
> and they shall call his name Immanuel”

(which means, God with us). [24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

* _God is with Us_

## 5th Reading [Luke 2:1-7]

[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

* _TLH_ 94 _Hark the Herald Angels Sing_ st 1, 3‑4

## 6th Reading [Luke 2:8-14]

[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. [11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”[13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
[14] “Glory to God in the highest,
    and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”
    
* _LSB_ 368 _Angels We Have Heard on High_ st 1‑ 2
    
## 7th Reading [Luke 2:15-20]

[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.
This is a special Christmas Eve as it is the first Christmas that Gateway and Unity have celebrated together, thanks be to God, and we thank our Lord Jesus for Pastor Tony and his congregation.
Yes, here we are together and the Lord is with us---in fact we consider tonight that name of Jesus proclaimed by the prophet Isaiah: *Immanuel---God is with us*.

For God was with us in the Garden of Eden---Adam spoke to God and God spoke to Adam.
God made his wife Eve from his rib and all was perfect in paradise.
But, as you know, as soon as Eve ate that forbidden fruit and gave it to her husband, and he ate, they new they were naked and **they hid themselves from the LORD God among the trees of the garden** ([Gn 3:8](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:8/) ESV), and a very sad state of affairs descended upon Eden.
God was still with Adam and Eve, but now they had reason to *hide* from Him, and that reason was the fear they felt before Him *because of their sin*.
*God is with us* became a problem because of their sin---their rebellion against God---and they hid.

Nothing has changed since that day, for there is a big problem when a sinner stands in the presence of God.
Generations came and went after Adam.
The wickedness of man grew great so that God regretted that He made him and wiped him out with a Flood, leaving alive only Noah and his family---eight souls in all.
Then came Abraham and his promised son, Isaac.
To Isaac came Jacob, and to Jacob came the twelve tribes of Israel.
And from the tribe of Levi came Moses, whom God called to save His chosen people from slavery in Egypt.
God was definitelly with the Israelites---a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night---as Moses led the people through the wilderness.
Finally, the great day came when Moses returned to the mountain where God had told him His name---YAHWEH---I AM.
There on that mountain the people worshiped their God as God had said they would ([Ex 3:12](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+3:12/)), and Moses went up the mountain to receive the Ten Commandments from the LORD.
But do you remember *what kind of a day that was*?
It was a terrifying day.
What was it like for the people when God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai?

> **"And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, ‘Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain _shall be put to death_. No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.’"** ([Ex 19:12‑13](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+19:12/) ESV)

There the Ten Commandments were given to Moses---*on the threat of death* to anyone else who would come close to God.
If that is *God is with us*, then we have much to fear, for we stand condemned by those Commandments, as the Israelites would soon find out when they worshiped the Golden Calf---God put 3,000 of them to death ([Ex 32](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+32/)).

Clearly, if all God gave us to live by were the Ten Commandments, we would all die,
**for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God** ([Rm 3:23](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3:23/)).
If *God is with us*, we will die in the presence of His glory.
Moses, who had not worshiped the Golden Calf, even asked to see God's glory:

> **Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” And [the LORD] said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘[YAHWEH].’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, _for man shall not see me and live_.”** ([Ex 33:18‑20](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+33:18/) ESV)

If that, then, is all there is that God would have us know---just His Commandments---if that is all there is, then the best we can have if *God is with us* is not to see his face, lest we die.

Yet going back before Moses to Jacob, a curious thing happened that makes us scratch our heads and wonder: Jacob wrestled with God and lived!
Jacob saw God face-to-face and he lived!
He even named the place where he wrestled with God *Peniel---the face of God*, **"For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered"** ([Gn 32:30](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+32:30/) ESV).
Why did Jacob see God face-to-face and live yet Moses could not?

Let that be the puzzle solved at Christmas; let God be the one to show mercy on whom He will show mercy.
We recall the prophecy of Isaiah:

> **For to us a child is born, to us a son is given;**\
> **and the government shall be upon his shoulder,**\
> **and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, _Mighty God_,**\
> **_Everlasting Father_, Prince of Peace.**

Baby Jesus---the Child who is born, the Son who is given to us---baby Jesus is none other than Mighty God, Everlasting Father. ...
Jesus is God and God is Jesus. ...
He is seen by sinners, and let us see how things turn out.
He is seen by Joseph, He is seen by His mother Mary whose body is not harmed in the least by bearing Him, He is seen by the shepherds and the animals in the stall.
Yet no harm comes to anyone.

And what a peculiar proclamation has been heard by those shepherds:

> **"Glory to God in the highest,**\
> **and on earth peace among those _with whom he is pleased_!"**

The message from the heavenly host is that God is pleased with us.
*Pleased with us? What about our sin?*
Behold the Christ Child in the manger and hear what Isaiah foretells of His death:

> **He was pierced for our transgressions;**\
> **he was crushed for our iniquities.** ([Is 53:5a](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53:5/) ESV)

He is born to be pierced and crushed for our sins.
What about our sin? Jesus is born to handle them.
Believe it, and God is pleased with you.
The heavenly Father's anger will be directed toward His beloved Son Jesus---not for His own sin but for your sin and for my sin.
He is born to be our sin-bearer.
As we see Him by faith as our sin-bearer, we can be sure that the proclamation of the heavenly host is for us:

> **"Glory to God in the highest,**\
> **and on earth peace among those _with whom he is pleased_!"**

Yes, *God is with us*---there are even sinners all around---and nobody is put to death.
Indeed, nobody will die who puts his hope in Him, in baby Jesus in the manger.
**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.

|:-----------------------------------------------:|

1. You cannot see God and live.
    1. Moses could not see the glory of God ([Ex 33:18‑23](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+33:18/)).
    1. Yet Jacob wrestled with God and saw Him face-to-face and lived ([Gn 32:22‑32](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+32:22/)).
1. When we see our own sin, we are afraid to be in God's presence.
    1. The high priest, and the high priest alone, could appear before the ark, and at that only once a year ([Lv 16](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+16/)).
    1. When Solomon prayed at the dedication of the temple, he asked, "But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth?" ([2Ch 6:18](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+6:18/))
