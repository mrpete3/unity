## Old Testament reading [Nm 6:22‑27 ESV]

[22] The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, [23] “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel: you shall say to them,

> [24] The LORD bless you and keep you;\
> [25] the LORD make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;\
> [26] the LORD lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.

[27] “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.”

## Epistle [Gal 3:23‑29 ESV]

[23] Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. [24] So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. [25] But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, [26] for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. [27] For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. [28] There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. [29] And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, today's sermon is about the circumcision and name of Jesus, for Jesus was born, and then circumcised and named when He was eight days old like any Jewish child.
You may remember that His second cousin John the Baptist was born of his mother, Elizabeth, while his father, Zechariah, could not speak---the Lord had stopped Zechariah's tongue when he did not believe what the angel Gabriel had told him:
that he and Elizabeth would have a son in their old age and name him John.
It did not stand to reason that he and Elizabeth would have a son, so the Lord stopped his tongue.
The angel Gabriel also said that John would be filled with the Holy Spirit, even in his mother's womb, which he was when he leapt in Elizabeth's womb when Mary came to visit with our Lord Jesus in *her* womb.

Even though certifiably full of the Holy Spirit and with a living faith, John the Baptist still received the external mark of circumcision when he was eight days old, like every Jewish boy, marking him as one of God's chosen people.
Even though our Lord Jesus was *conceived* by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, He, too, was circumcised when He was eight days old, like every Jewish boy, marking Him as one of God's chosen people.

The first one ever circumcised, though, was not eight days old---he was 99 *years* old.
Yes, Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised and God have him the command not only to be circumcised himself, but also to circumcise **“every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not your offspring”** [(Gn 17:12)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2017%3A12/).
And to add to that, God said to Abraham, **“So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant”** [(Gn 17:13 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%2017%3A13/).

Now the first thing that you might think about Abraham's circumcision is this: “What a silly thing it is for God to circumcise a 99-year-old man.”
The next issue you have is explaining in Sunday School to children what circumcision is.
It is embarrassing, but our teachers do it skillfully.
The next issue you have is explaining in Sunday School that this is a good thing that God has done to Abraham.
(If you have not visited Sunday School or Saturday youth Bible study, you might enjoy it.)
It seems absurd for God to mutilate a male's private parts and call it a covenant.
Our reason cannot bear it.

Beloved in the Lord, God is not particularly concerned with what our reason can or cannot bear.
What about God promising Abraham and Sarah that they would have a son in their old age?
What about God promising Zechariah and Elizabeth that they would have a son in their old age?
What about God telling Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac?
What about God telling Gideon that he would fight the Midianites with 300 men instead of 30,000 men?
What about the prophet Elijah telling the starving widow to feed him?
What about the prophet Elisha telling the bankrupt widow to borrow empty vessels, and not too few?
Our reason cannot bear it.
*What about God sending His Son to die on a Cross?*
And, beloved in the Lord, His Son's name is Jesus, and “Jesus” means “Savior.”
A dead Son saving us?
Our reason cannot bear it.

Our reason, if we hold on to it, gets us into idolatry.
The biggest intellectual movement in Europe in the 19th century was rationalism: reason is the chief source of knowledge.
“If your reason can't bear it, away with it!”
The advances of science and technology led man to think that our reason is god.
What did that movement give us?
Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin---men of sharp reason---men willing to enforce their reason over others.
Millions were murdered for seeing things another way.
Millions more died in the war they started with their reason.

So, be careful about reason, and do not let it be your idol.
Let your reason serve God's Word---let your reason serve the Bible, not the other way around.
Your reason is not necessary to to be saved: only faith--Faith Alone.
Our Lord Jesus says that heaven will be full of only children ... and those who believe like they do [(Lk 10:21)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+10:21/).
See, your reason even balks at that. Put your idol away!

Finally, those who are offended by circumcision may also be offended by Baptism.
Yet the Bible says that Baptism is the circumcision done by Christ [(Col 2:11‑12)](http://www.esvbible.org/Colossians%202%3A11-12/).

There, that was worth getting up for on New Year's Day.
AMEN.
