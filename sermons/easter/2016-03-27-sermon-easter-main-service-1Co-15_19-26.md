## Old Testament [Is 65:17-25 ESV]

	[17] “For behold, I create new heavens  
	and a new earth,  
	and the former things shall not be remembered  
		or come into mind.
	[18] But be glad and rejoice forever
		in that which I create;
	for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy,
		and her people to be a gladness.
	[19] I will rejoice in Jerusalem
		and be glad in my people;
	no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping
		and the cry of distress.
	[20] No more shall there be in it
		an infant who lives but a few days,
		or an old man who does not fill out his days,
	for the young man shall die a hundred years old,
		and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.
	[21] They shall build houses and inhabit them;
		they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
	[22] They shall not build and another inhabit;
		they shall not plant and another eat;
	for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be,
		and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
	[23] They shall not labor in vain
		or bear children for calamity,
	for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD,
		and their descendants with them.
	[24] Before they call I will answer;
		while they are yet speaking I will hear.
	[25] The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;
		the lion shall eat straw like the ox,
		and dust shall be the serpent's food.
	They shall not hurt or destroy
		in all my holy mountain,” says the LORD.

## Epistle [1Co 15:19-26 ESV; sermon text]

[19] If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.

[20] But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. [21] For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. [22] For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. [23] But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. [24] Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. [25] For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. [26] The last enemy to be destroyed is death.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 24:1-12 ESV]

[1] But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. [2] And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, [3] but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. [4] While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. [5] And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? [6] He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, [7] that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” [8] And they remembered his words, [9] and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. [10] Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, [11] but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. [12] But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.

## Introit [Ps 999:9-9; antiphon: Ps 999:9]

The *LSB Pastoral Care Companion* uses NKJV for Jb 19:23‑27 	in the committal service, so we will have it read publicly in the cemetery for the Easter sunrise service as well.
