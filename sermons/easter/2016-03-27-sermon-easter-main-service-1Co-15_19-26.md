## Old Testament [Is 65:17-25 ESV]

[17] “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth,
and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.
[18] But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;
for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness.
[19] I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people;
no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.
[20] No more shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days,
or an old man who does not fill out his days,
for the young man shall die a hundred years old,
and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.
[21] They shall build houses and inhabit them;
they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
[22] They shall not build and another inhabit;
they shall not plant and another eat;
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be,
and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
[23] They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity,
for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD,
and their descendants with them.
[24] Before they call I will answer; while they are yet speaking I will hear.
[25] The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;
the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food.
They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain,” says the LORD.

## Epistle [1Co 15:19-26 ESV; sermon text]

[19] If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.

[20] But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. [21] For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. [22] For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. [23] But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. [24] Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. [25] For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. [26] The last enemy to be destroyed is death.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 24:1-12 ESV]

[1] But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. [2] And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, [3] but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. [4] While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. [5] And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? [6] He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, [7] that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” [8] And they remembered his words, [9] and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. [10] Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, [11] but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. [12] But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.

## Introit [Ex. 15:2a, 6, 13, 17-18; antiphon: Ex. 15:1b]

> I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed | gloriously;*  
> the horse and his rider he has thrown in- | to the sea.  
> The LORD is my strength | and my song,*  
> and he has become my sal- | vation;  
> Your right hand, O LORD, glorious | in power,*  
> your right hand, O LORD, shatters the | enemy.  
> You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you | have redeemed;*  
> you have guided them by your strength to your ho- | ly abode.  
> You will bring them in and plant them on your own | mountain,*  
> the place, O LORD, which you have made for | your abode,  
> the sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have es- | tablished.*  
> The LORD will reign forever and | ever.


## Collect

O God, for our redemption You gave Your only-begotten Son to the death of the cross and by His glorious resurrection delivered us from the power of the enemy. Grant that all our sin may be drowned through daily repentance and that day by day we may arise to live before You in righteousness and purity forever;
through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, how many of you have seen the resurrection of the dead?
You may have seen the dead, but how many of you have seen the *resurrection* of the dead?
I am not here to get you to buy into something you have never seen,
but I *am* proclaiming what others *have* seen and has been attested in many ways, namely, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

Yet for those who believe only what they see and say there is no resurrection of the dead, **if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied** [(1Co 15:16‑19 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2015%3A16-19/).

So, let us go to the heart of the matter: Is there or is there not a resurrection of the dead?

Jesus, before His own Crucifixion and Resurrection, bumped heads with the Sadducees, who teach that there is no resurrection of the dead.
Jesus told them, **“You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God”** [(Mt 22:29)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2022%3A29/).
Listen first, then, to the testimony of the Scriptures, for

<center>IN FACT CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD.</center>

Job confesses in chapter 19,

> **“I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth. And _after my skin is destroyed_, this I know, That _in my flesh I shall see God_.”** [(Jb 19:25‑26 NKJV)](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nkjv/job/19.html)<sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">§</a>]</sup>

David writes in Psalm 16, foreseeing the resurrection of Christ [(Ac 2:25‑32)](http://www.esvbible.org/Acts%202%3A25-32/),

> **“Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices;**  
> **my flesh also dwells secure.**  
> **For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,**  
> **or let your holy one see corruption.”** [(Ps 16:9‑10)](http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm%2016%3A9-10/)

There is more.<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">†</a>]</sup>
The prophet Isaiah proclaims in chapter 53,

> **“Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him;**  
> **he has put him to grief;**  
> **when his soul makes an offering for guilt,**  
> **_he shall see his offspring_; he shall prolong his days;**  
> **the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand,”** [(Is 53:10 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2053%3A10/)

speaking of Christ, after being crushed and put to death, being alive again to see His offspring and to do the will of the LORD.

And finally, the prophet Hosea proclaims in chapter 6,

> **“Come, let us return to the LORD;**  
> **for he has torn us, that he may heal us;**  
> **he has struck us down, and he will bind us up.**  
> **After two days he will revive us;**  
> **_on the third day he will raise us up_,**  
> **that we may live before him.”** [(Hos 6:1‑2 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Hosea%206%3A1-2/)	

Sounds like Jesus being raised from the dead on the third day. But did you catch it?
The prophet says, **“Us.”** **“On the third day he will raise _us_ up, that we may live before Him.”**
The Scriptures proclaim that *you too* will be raised up with Him to live before Him!

Well, let us check first to make sure that He was raised from the dead.
At the time of the early Church, there were teachers who taught *contrary* to the apostles. They are known as heretics or false teachers.
St Paul mentions two of them, Hymenaeus and Philetus, who taught that the resurrection had already happened [(2Tm 2:17‑18)](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Timothy%202%3A17-18/), in other words, that you and I—today—are already resurrected.
They were wrong about that, but apparently they taught that Christ *had* been resurrected.

Of course, there were the Jews, who denied that Jesus is the Messiah and denied that He was resurrected.
However, they at least acknowledged that Jesus was crucified and that the Christians *say* Jesus is alive: “We do not think so, but they do.”

And finally, the false prophet Mohammed denied that Jesus died at all, but he did teach that Jesus was alive.

In all these cases, the false teachers either acknowledged that Jesus had been resurrected, or that He was still alive, or that there are people who believe that He is alive and exists:
*you have to deal with Christ's Resurrection* in some way, even if you are not Christian.
In other words, the Resurrection of Christ was *the big issue* for hundreds of years!

Count the manuscripts.
People wrote things down in those days, and that was expensive business: paper was expensive, paying a scribe to make copies was expensive.
But there are [thousands](http://www.focusonthefamily.com/faith/the-study-of-god/how-do-we-know-the-bible-is-true/how-did-we-get-the-bible) of ancient copies and fragments of the New Testament that have been discovered with the proclamation of the Resurrection of Christ—more than *any* event or person recorded in ancient history.

And then there were the apostles themselves.

On Pentecost, the apostle Peter proclaimed,

> **“[David] foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that _we all are witnesses_.”** [(Ac 2:31‑32 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Acts%202%3A31-32/)

(Sorry Lebron.)
You know what the apostle Paul proclaimed about the Resurrection:

> **“But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.”**

The apostles, as far as we know, universally proclaimed the Resurrection of Jesus *and were not afraid to die for it*, because

<center>IN FACT CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD.</center>

The Book of Acts is a testimony of the Holy Spirit working through the preaching of *[Point to Crucifixion window]* Christ crucified for our trespasses *[Point to Resurrection window]* and raised for our justification [(Rm 4:25)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%204%3A25/).
Such preaching and testimony of the Holy Spirit has gone on for 2,000 years and is the subject of many books.

And finally, there is the testimony of the Holy Spirit *[Point to baptismal font]* through the Sacrament of Holy Baptism.
We turn again to the apostle Peter:

> **“Baptism, … now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, _through the resurrection of Jesus Christ_.”** [(1Pt 3:21 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Peter%203%3A21/)

And again the apostle Paul:

> **“We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.”** [(Rm 6:4‑5 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%206%3A4-5/)

The apostles proclaim not only that in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, but that *you* are personally connected to His Resurrection *as sure as you are baptized*.
Believe it—*believe* in your Baptism—and you *have* the resurrection of your own body from the dead.

You are reborn *now* by the Holy Spirit through Baptism [(Jn 3:5)](http://www.esvbible.org/John%203%3A5/) and are made children of God, to live under Christ and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, blessedness. Let this be your personal testimony of Christ's Resurrection. And in your final hour, you will experience victory over death, and on the Last Day, you will be raised from your grave according to Jesus' Words:

> **“I am the resurrection and the life,”** says the Lord.
**“He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in Me will never die.”** (Jn 11:25‑26 NIV)<sup>[<a name="id0003" href="#ftn.id0003">‡</a>]</sup>

And you will have by then seen with your own eyes the resurrection of the dead. And you will see one more thing: Christ will destroy death itself. AMEN.

## Notes

If we are to believe in the Resurrection of Christ, is the heart of the Christian faith to believe in something that neither you nor anyone else has seen?
Not so much as it is to believe that God did it for you.
