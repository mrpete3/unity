## Old Testament [Is 65:17-25 ESV]

[17] “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth,
and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.
[18] But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;
for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness.
[19] I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people;
no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.
[20] No more shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days,
or an old man who does not fill out his days,
for the young man shall die a hundred years old,
and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.
[21] They shall build houses and inhabit them;
they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
[22] They shall not build and another inhabit;
they shall not plant and another eat;
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be,
and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
[23] They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity,
for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD,
and their descendants with them.
[24] Before they call I will answer; while they are yet speaking I will hear.
[25] The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;
the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food.
They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain,” says the LORD.

## Epistle [1Co 15:19-26 ESV; sermon text]

[19] If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.

[20] But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. [21] For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. [22] For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. [23] But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. [24] Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. [25] For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. [26] The last enemy to be destroyed is death.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 24:1-12 ESV]

[1] But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. [2] And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, [3] but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. [4] While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. [5] And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? [6] He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, [7] that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” [8] And they remembered his words, [9] and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. [10] Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, [11] but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. [12] But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.

## Introit [Ex. 15:2a, 6, 13, 17-18; antiphon: Ex. 15:1b]

> I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed | gloriously;*
> the horse and his rider he has thrown in- | to the sea.
> The LORD is my strength | and my song,*
> and he has become my sal- | vation;
> Your right hand, O LORD, glorious | in power,*
> your right hand, O LORD, shatters the | enemy.
> You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you | have redeemed;*
> you have guided them by your strength to your ho- | ly abode.
> You will bring them in and plant them on your own | mountain,*
> the place, O LORD, which you have made for | your abode,
> the sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have es- | tablished.*
> The LORD will reign forever and | ever.


## Collect

O God, for our redemption You gave Your only-begotten Son to the death of the cross and by His glorious resurrection delivered us from the power of the enemy. Grant that all our sin may be drowned through daily repentance and that day by day we may arise to live before You in righteousness and purity forever;
through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, I am asking you to believe in the resurrection of the dead.

> **If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.**

For those who do not believe there is a resurrection of the dead, **we[, Christians,] are of all people most to be pitied**.
So, let us go to the heart of the matter: Is there or is there not a resurrection of the dead?
Whom among you has seen the resurrection of the dead?

The testimony of the Bible.
If Jesus was to die for our sins, He had to be raised (Hos 6:2; Ps 16:10; Is 53:10).

The testimony of the Holy Spirit for 2,000 years.

AMEN.

## Outline

<center>BUT IN FACT CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD.</center>

1. I am asking you to believe in the resurrection of the dead.
    1. Have you seen the resurrection of the dead?
    1. **We are of all people most to be pitied.**
1. BUT IN FACT CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD.
    1. OT testimony
        1. [Ps 16:10](http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm%2016%3A10/)
        1. [Is 53:10](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2053%3A10/)
        1. [Hos 6:1‑3](http://www.esvbible.org/Hosea%206%3A1-3/)
    1. Testimony of the eyewitnesses
        1. Heretics for hundreds of years have to acknowledge the Resurrection of Jesus.
            1. The Jews who do not believe that Jesus is their Messiah must say at least that the Christians say Jesus is alive—we do not think so, but they do.
            1. Even Mohammed says Jesus is alive.
        1. Many manuscripts
        1. The Resurrection of Jesus is the most attested event in human history.
    1. Testimony of the apostles
        1. They went out in all the world.
        1. They did not fear death.
    1. Testimony of the Holy Spirit throughout the history of the Church
    1. Testimony of the Holy Spirit today
        1. Through preaching
        1. Through Baptism [(Rm 6:4)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%206%3A4/)
    1. We are reborn now through Baptism and experience victory over sin. We die in this faith and experience victory over death. On the Last Day, we will be raised from our graves and Christ will destroy death itself.

## Notes

If we are to believe in the Resurrection of Christ, is the heart of the Christian faith to believe in something that neither you nor anyone else has seen?
Not so much as it is to believe that God did it for you.

The *LSB Pastoral Care Companion* uses NKJV for Jb 19:23‑27 	in the committal service, so we will have it read publicly in the cemetery for the Easter sunrise service as well.
