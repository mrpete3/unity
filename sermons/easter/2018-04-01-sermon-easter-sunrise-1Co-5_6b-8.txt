## First Reading [1Co 5:6b‑8 ESV]

[6b] Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? [7] Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. [8] Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 20:1‑18 ESV]

[1] Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. [2] So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” [3] So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. [4] Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. [5] And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. [6] Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, [7] and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus'[a] head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. [8] Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; [9] for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. [10] Then the disciples went back to their homes.
[11] But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. [12] And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. [13] They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” [14] Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. [15] Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” [16] Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic,[b] “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). [17] Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” [18] Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”—and that he had said these things to her.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, *He is risen! He is risen indeed, Alleuia!*
Jesus Christ has burst His tomb.

> **When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. _And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb_ and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.** (Mt 27:57‑61 ESV)

Jesus of Nazareth was crucified under Pontius Pilate and buried in a new tomb belonging to Joseph of Arimathea; Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Sanhedrin that had sentenced Jesus to death [(Mk 15:43)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+15/).
Apparently, not all of the Sanhedrin hated Jesus, but apparently not one of them raised his voice to defend Him at His trial.
Even Christ's own disciples deserted and denied Him.
Joseph of Arimathea, however, stepped up after our Lord's death to honor Him by personally going to Pontius Pilate and asking for the dead body of our Lord and reverently burying Him *in his own tomb*; by this, he honored our Lord Jesus.
Nicodemus, the Pharisee, also stepped up after our Lord's death to honor Him by helping Joseph bind Jesus' body in cloths and spices [(Jn 19:38‑42)](https://www.esv.org/John+19/).
Apparently, not all the Pharisees hated Jesus, either.
Between all the Pharisees and all the members of the Sanhedrin who hated Jesus, there were some who nevertheless believed in Him.
*They were not disappointed.*
It was brave of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus to stick out their necks to honor Jesus, even though they did it quietly.
This was their way of showing that they believed in Jesus and certainly did not think He deserved to die.
What did they think would happen at Joseph's tomb, which now held the body of Jesus?
Did they have an idea that Christ would burst the tomb?
Joseph rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.

But there were also be soldiers to guard the tomb of Jesus.

> **The next day, ... the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’ Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.” Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. _Go, make it as secure as you can._” So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.** [(Mt 27:62‑66 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+27/)

A Roman military guard now guards the tomb *to no avail*. Military---if a military guard lets a prisoner escape, he pays for it with his life [(Ac 16:27)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+16/).
There is *no way* for Jesus' disciples to steal His body and make up a story---the Army stands in the way---Jesus' tomb is guarded like Fort Knox, but *to no avail*.

Beloved in the Lord, we try to stay alive, but to no avail.
Behold the tombs that surround us. Sin put the faithful departed in these tombs and we will one day join them---**for the wages of sin is death** [(Rm 6:23 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6/).
God did not create death. But sin infected creation when Adam and Eve believed Satan's lie that God cannot be trusted.
When man's trust of God was broken, death came bursting into the Garden of Eden and infected Adam and Eve and then all of us.
There is no escaping sin, especially with Satan stirring up our flesh to keep believing that God cannot be trusted---there is no escaping the tomb.
Go to the doctor all we want, but we still die from our sin.

Beloved in the Lord, hear how the Old Testament prophet Isaiah foretold that Jesus would also die, *but not for any sin of His own*.

> **And they made his grave with the wicked**\
> **and with a rich man in his death,**\
> **although he had done _no violence,_**\
> **and there was _no deceit_ in his mouth.** [(Is 53:9 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53/)

There was no violence, no deceit, no sin for which Jesus died.
Not only that, but Jesus fervently trusted His Father throughout His agony and death.

> **Into your hand I commit my spirit;**\
> **you have redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.** [(Ps 31:5; Lk 23:46  ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+31:5/)

For no sin of His own did He die, and He was buried in a rich man's tomb---the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, says the prophet Isaiah.
Jesus did not die for His own sin: He died for *our* own sin.

> **He was pierced _for our transgressions_;**\
> **he was crushed _for our iniquities_;**\
> **upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,**\
> **and with his wounds we are healed.** [(Is 53:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53/)

God chose to send His Son as our servant *to die the death our sins deserve*.
Thank you, Jesus!
Through the Father's injustice to His Son, He worked justice for sin by punishing sin *in full*.
The Son never stopped trusting His Father, the Son never stopped loving His Father.
Jesus never lost faith---He never doubted, He never wavered, He trusted to the end.
For He knew what was the end of His faith---*the joy of the Resurrection of the dead*---not only His Resurrection *but our own Resurrection by faith in Him*.
The Lutheran Cemetery Association did not miss this point.
If it was too dark for you to read the right gatepost of the cemetery on the way in, read it on the way out concerning Christ's promise of *your* Resurrection.

> **I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in Me will never die.** (Jn 11:25 NIV84)]

God the Father chose the place and time in history for His Son to die---to burst the tomb and publicly demonstrate His Resurrection so that we can *trust our forgiveness by His death and trust our own Resurrection by His Resurrection*.
God is trustworthy!
Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were not disappointed by believing Jesus, and neither are we.
We are saved by trust; we are saved by faith in who Jesus is---Son of Man and Son of God---and what Jesus did---He died in punishment for our sins and was raised again to demonstrate the Resurrection of our mortal bodies, which will be just like His.
**"Peace be with you,"** declares our risen Lord Jesus. "Your sins are forgiven, and your perishable body will put on the imperishable, and your mortal body will put on immortality" [(1Co 15:53)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+15:53/).
AMEN.

## Notes

Mt 27:61. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses (Mk 15:47).
Mary the mother of Joses may possibly be Mary the wife of Clopas (Mk 15:40; Jn 19:25), a sister to Mary the mother of Jesus.
In Mk 15:40 she is called "Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses."
James the younger is likely James the son of Alphaeus, one of the twelve apostles.
If she is Mary the wife of Clopas in Jn 19:25, then she may be the wife of Cleopas, who saw Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Lk 24:18).

Lk 24:18. Cleopas is only mentioned here as a disciple.
