## First Reading [1Co 5:6b‑8 ESV]

[6b] Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? [7] Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. [8] Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 20:1‑18 ESV]

[1] Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. [2] So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” [3] So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. [4] Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. [5] And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. [6] Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, [7] and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus'[a] head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. [8] Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; [9] for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. [10] Then the disciples went back to their homes.
[11] But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. [12] And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. [13] They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” [14] Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. [15] Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” [16] Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic,[b] “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). [17] Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” [18] Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”—and that he had said these things to her.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, *He is risen! He is risen indeed, Alleuia!*
Jesus Christ is risen from His tomb.
The Bible tells us a few things about Jesus' tomb.

> **When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. _And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb_ and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.** (Mt 27:57‑61 ESV)

Jesus of Nazareth was crucified under Pontius Pilate and buried in a new tomb by Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin that had sentenced Jesus to death [(Mk 15:43)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+15/).
Joseph was a member of the Sanhedrin!
Apparently, not all in the Sanhedrin hated Jesus.
Joseph of Arimathea did not, and showed honor to the death of our Lord by personally going to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, and asking for the dead body of our Lord and reverently burying Him *in His own tomb*.
John's Gospel tells us that Nicodemus, the Pharisee, helped Joseph bind Jesus' body in cloths and spices according to the custom of the Jews [(Jn 19:38‑42 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+19/).
Apparently, not all the Pharisees hated Jesus.
Between all the Pharisees and all the members of the Sanhedrin who hated Jesus, there were some who believed in Him.
It is comforting to know that Joseph and Nicodemus somehow knew each other and then took it upon themselves to bury our Lord.
This was their way to confess that they believed Jesus and certainly did not think He deserved to die.
Little did they know what was to happen at Joseph's tomb, which now held the body of Jesus.
Joseph rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.

> **The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate [63] and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’ [64] Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.” [65] Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.” [66] So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.** [(Mt 27:62‑66 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+27/)

Beloved in the Lord, **"Peace be with you."**

*You are in as much trouble as Jesus is still in the grave.* Face the future in peace.

## Notes

Mt 27:61. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses (Mk 15:47).
Mary the mother of Joses may possibly be Mary the wife of Clopas (Mk 15:40; Jn 19:25), a sister to Mary the mother of Jesus.
In Mk 15:40 she is called "Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses."
James the younger is likely James the son of Alphaeus, one of the twelve apostles.
If she is Mary the wife of Clopas in Jn 19:25, then she may be the wife of Cleopas, who saw Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Lk 24:18).

Lk 24:18. Cleopas is only mentioned here as a disciple.
