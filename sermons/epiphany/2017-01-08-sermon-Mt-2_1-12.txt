## Epistle [Eph 3:1‑12 ESV]

[1] For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles—[2] assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, [3] how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. [4] When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, [5] which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. [6] This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.

[7] Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power. [8] To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, [9] and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, [10] so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. [11] This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, [12] in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 2:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, [2] saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” [3] When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; [4] and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. [5] They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:

> [6] “‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,\
>  are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;\
> for from you shall come a ruler\
> who will shepherd my people Israel.’”
 
 [7] Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. [8] And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” [9] After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. [10] When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. [11] And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. [12] And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, who are the magi who followed the star and came to Herod, wanting to worship the newborn King of the Jews?
You have heard about them in the traditional Christmas story---_[Point to Christmas window]_ told by our stained glass window.
The Christ Child, as you know, is born of his mother Mary, with his stepfather Joseph right there to care for them.
**And ... there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night** [(Lk 2:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2/).
The shepherds, of course, were told by the angel to go to where Jesus had been born and there they found Him **wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger** (Lk 2:12 ESV).
Off in the background of the window, you see the shadows of three riders mounted on camels; these are the wise men, the *magi*, of our Holy Gospel.

Who are the magi?
How many of them came to worship Jesus?
The stained glass window says three, but notice that the Holy Gospel does not mention how many magi there were.
There were more than one and *tradition* has depicted them as three, just as you see in the window and just as you say when you sing, *We three kings of orient are*.
How many magi really came? We do not know.
You know me, though, I love the number three: it reminds me of my best friend---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

But *who* are the magi?
They are wise men in the sense of someone we would say has the ability to predict things---a diviner---someone who practices *divination*, the art or practice that seeks to foresee or foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge.[^1]
Immediately, I hope your biblical mind wakes up and says,
"You better be careful about that!"
because the Bible warns us *against* divination.
Moses instructed the Israelites, saying,

[^1]: [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divination](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divination), accessed 8 January 2017

> **“These nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to fortune-tellers and to diviners. But as for you, the LORD your God has _not allowed you to do this_.”** [(Dt 18:14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+18/)

Stay away from divination! And Samuel warned Saul, saying,

> **“For rebellion is as the _sin of divination_,**\
> **and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry.**\
> **Because you[, Saul,] have rejected the word of the LORD,**\
> **he has also rejected you from being king.”** [(1Sm 15:23 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+15/)

So there you have it, divination is a sin, yet the magi were *magicians*---they practiced divination and followed a star.
It stands to reason that the magi were *astrologers*.
You and I should have nothing to do with astrology, yet these astrologers come to worship baby Jesus.
What are you to make of that?

First of all, you are not to make of it that astrology is good and that you should seek God's wisdom from the horoscope. Period. Stay away from astrology.
Did you hear what Samuel told Saul?
**"Because you have rejected the word of the LORD ..."**
By embracing astrology or divination, you are rejecting the word of the LORD for which the LORD will reject you as He did Saul.
For nowhere has God told you to seek Him through divination or astrology.
He tells you to seek Him in His *Word*; His Word is the *Bible* and His Word made flesh is *Jesus*. Seek God nowhere else---here He is---baby Jesus---*He is yours*!
Here He is *where two or three are gathered in My name*, listening to all He has commanded you. *He is yours!*
_[Point to altar]_ Here He is: **Take, eat, this is My body, which is given for you. ... Drink of it, all of you. This cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for your for the forgiveness of your sins.**
*He is yours!*
Seek Him and you have Him in His Word, and in His Word alone.

Second of all, do not slam the wise men for, after all, they have come to worship the King of the Jews.
You know very well that when Herod says He wants to worship the King of the Jews, He has in mind to *kill Him*. Herod is evil and under Satan's control.
You know also very well that the magi *truly* want to worship the King of the Jews and that they have brought Him precious gifts---the best of the east---they have brought Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

What are you to make of that?

> *Manifest in gracious will,*\
> *Ever bringing good from ill;*\
> *Anthems be to Thee addressed,*\
> *God in man made manifest.*[^2]

[^2]: _LSB_ 394, st 3

That is not our sermon hymn today, but it could have been.
And Jaan sang it to me this week while we were in the car together.
Here you have it:

> *Manifest in gracious will,*\
> *Ever bringing good from ill.*\

Christ is manifest even as a baby, for His birth draws the magi---foreigners under the influence of idols and satanic arts---He draws the magi---who knows? He might have dragged them---out of idolatry to worship Him, the King of the Jews.
Astrology is not good, but Christ is manifest---Christ shines forth---in that He can even use astrology to bring the magi to Him---Christ shines forth by bringing good from ill---bringing good from evil.
The conclusion I draw from the Scriptures---but I must honestly call it speculation because we know nothing more about the magi other than today's Holy Gospel---the conclusion I draw is that after the angel warned them not to return to Herod, they went home worshiping Jesus, the King of the Jews.
Back home, I hope they consulted the Hebrew Scriptures that the prophet Daniel had taught and written in Babylon and there they might have come across Old Testament prophecies like the prophecy of Micah[^3] that the chief priests and scribes had read to Herod:

> **“And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,**\
> **are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;**\
> **for from you shall come a ruler**\
> **who will shepherd my people Israel.”**

[^3]: Mi 5:2

Micah also prophesied that the ruler of Israel came forth from of old, from ancient days, long before His conception.
If the magi were consulting the Hebrew Scriptures, they would not have had to look far to read what Isaiah had prophesied---**He was pierced for our transgressions; He was crushed for our iniquities** [(Is 53:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+53/)---they could have read Isaiah and wondered what kind of death this Child would die.

Speaking of children dying, you know what happens next in Matthew, chapter 2, after the magi return to their country.

> **Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.** [(Mt 2:16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+2/)

I cannot imagine what good God worked out the slaughter of those innocent children at the hands of Herod---my reason cannot bear---but I believe He did it.
He worked good out of evil as He always does.
But is simply cannot comprehend it, for Joseph had already been warned and took Mary and Jesus to Egypt.
Jesus was not even in Bethlehem.
God could have stopped Herod from killing the baby boys of Bethlehem, but He did not. The terrible slaughter fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah[^4]:

> **“A voice was heard in Ramah,**\
> ** weeping and loud lamentation,**\
> **Rachel weeping for her children;**\
> **she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”** [(Mt 2:18 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+2/)

[^4]: Jer 31:15

Beloved in the Lord, I cannot imagine was good God worked from the slaughter of those children, but I do know about the Cross of Jesus.
That was terrible bloodshed, too.
A murderer freed so our righteous Savior could die His death.
What He worked throught *that* evil was the greatest good knows to man: our redemption from death, devil, and hell by the forgiveness of our sins.
Where Jesus appears, He turns evil for our good.
AMEN.
