## Epistle [Eph 3:1‑12 ESV]

[1] For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles—[2] assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, [3] how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. [4] When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, [5] which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. [6] This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.

[7] Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power. [8] To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, [9] and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, [10] so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. [11] This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, [12] in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 2:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, [2] saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” [3] When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; [4] and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. [5] They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:

> [6] “‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,\
>  are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;\
> for from you shall come a ruler\
> who will shepherd my people Israel.’”
 
 [7] Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. [8] And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” [9] After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. [10] When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. [11] And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. [12] And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, who were the magi who followed the star and came to Herod, wanting to worship the newborn King of the Jews?
You have heard about them many times in the traditional Christmas story.
_[Point to Christmas window]_ The story is traditionally told as it is depicted in our stained glass window.
The Christ Child, as you know, is born of his mother Mary, with his stepfather Joseph right there to care for them.
**And ... there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night** [(Lk 2:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2/).
The shepherds, of course, were told by the angel to come to where Jesus had been born and there they would find Him **wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger** (Lk 2:12 ESV).
Off in the background of the window, you see the shadows of three riders mounted on camels; these are the wise men, the *magi*, of our Holy Gospel.

How many magi came?
The stained glass window says three, but you will notice that the Holy Gospel does not mention how many magi there were.
There were more than one and *tradition* has depicted them as three, just as you see in the window and just as you say when you sing, *We three kings of orient are*.
How many magi really came? We do not know.
You know me, though, I love the number three: it reminds me of my best friend---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

*Who* were the magi?
They were wise men in the sense of someone we would call a predicter or a diviner---someone who practices divination, the art or practice that seeks to foresee or foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge.[^1]
Immediately, I hope you biblical mind wakes up and says,
"You better be careful about that!"
because the Bible warns us *against* divination with verses like these.
Moses instructed the Israelites, saying,

[^1]: [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divination](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divination), accessed 8 January 2017

> **“These nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to fortune-tellers and to diviners. But as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do this.”** [(Dt 18:14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+18/)

And Samuel warned Saul, saying,

> **“For rebellion is as the _sin of divination_,**\
> **and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry.**\
> **Because you have rejected the word of the LORD,**\
> **he has also rejected you from being king.”** [(1Sm 15:23 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+15/)

So there you have it, divination is a sin---and for this reason avoid astrology!---yet the magi practiced divination and followed a star.
It stands to reason that the magi *were* astrologers---and they came to worship baby Jesus.
What are you to make of it?

First of all, you are not to make of it that astrology is good and that you should seek God's wisdom from the horoscope. Period.
Did you hear what Samuel told Saul?
**"Because you have rejected the word of the LORD ..."**
By embracing astrology or divination, you are rejecting the word of the LORD for which the LORD will reject you as He did Saul.
Furthermomre, nowhere has God told you to seek Him through divination or astrology.
He tells you to seek Him in His Word; His Word is the Bible and His Word made flesh is Jesus. Seek God nowhere else---here He is, baby Jesus, *He is yours*!


AMEN.
