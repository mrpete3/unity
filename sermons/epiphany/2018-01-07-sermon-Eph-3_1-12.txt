## Epistle [Eph 3:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

[1] For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles---[2] assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, [3] how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. [4] When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, [5] which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. [6] This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.

[7] Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power. [8] To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, [9] and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, [10] so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. [11] This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, [12] in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.

[2] εἴ γε ἠκούσατε τὴν οἰκονομίαν τῆς χάριτος τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς δοθείσης μοι εἰς ὑμᾶς,

## Holy Gospel [Mt 2:1‑12 ESV]

[1] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, [2] saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” [3] When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; [4] and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. [5] They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:

> [6] “‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,\
> are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;\
> for from you shall come a ruler\
> who will shepherd my people Israel.’”

[7] Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. [8] And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” [9] After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. [10] When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. [11] And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. [12] And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.

## Introit [Ps 45:6-8a; antiphon: Ps 45:17]

> I will cause your name to be remembered in all gener- | ations;\*\
> therefore nations will praise you forever and | ever.\
> Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kngdom is a scepter of up- | rightness;\*\
> you have loved righteousness and hated | wickedness.\
> Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your com- | panions;\*\
> your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and | cassia.\

## Collect

O God, by the leading of a star You made known Your only-begotten Son to the Gentiles. Lead us, who know You by faith, to enjoy in heaven the fullness of Your divine presence; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Let us again go back into the wilderness---where, by the way, the temperature could be quite hot---I would rather live in Cleveland---let us go back into the hot, miseralble wilderness with Moses and the Israelites.
Moses was on Mount Horeb with God, and God Himself wrote these Commandments on two tablets of stone:

1. **You shall have no other gods.**\
2. **You shall not misuse the name of the Lord, your God.**\
3. **Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy,** which we are doing today.\
4. **Honor your father and your mother.**\
5. **You shall not murder.**\
6. **You shall not commit adultery.**\
7. **You shall not steal.**\
8. **You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.**\
9. **You shall not covet your neighbor's house.**\
10. **You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything the belongs to your neighbor.**

God *Himself* wrote these Commandments for the Hebrew people on two tablets of stone.
The people were at the bottom waiting for Moses and they grew impatient.

> **When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him, “Up, make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”** [(Ex 32:1 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+32/)

Nothing was wrong other than they got tired of waiting,
and then they did something terrible.
Do you remember what it was?

> **So Aaron said to them, “Take off the rings of gold that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.” So all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf. And they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”** [(Ex 32:2‑4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+32/)

What an insult to the true God of Israel, who had *really* saved them from slavery in Egypt!
It is as if I made a statue of Captain America and took it to Public Square on Good Friday and bowed before it and said, "On this day, Captain America saved me from my sins!"
Blasphemy. Idolatry.
After everything the LORD had done to save the Israelites!
430 years before [(Ex 12:40)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+12/), He had saved them from famine by raising up Joseph to store food for them in Egypt.
The LORD blessed them in Egypt; the Hebrews multiplied greatly in Egypt.
And one day, as you may recall, there was a new Pharaoh who did not know Joseph.
The new Pharaoh enslaved the Hebrews, but they multiplied *even more* because the LORD was with them [(Ex 1:12)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+1/).

And now, the LORD raised up Moses to lead them out of Egyptian slavery and take them safely to the Promised Land.
At this point, the LORD had already sent the ten plagues to Egypt to convice Pharaoh to finally do what Moses had commanded: "Let my people go."
At this point, the LORD had already drowned hard-hearted Pharaoh and all his host in the Red Sea, yet led His people Israel through the water on dry ground, foreshadowing our own Baptism, which saves us.
The people who worshiped the golden calf had lived though all of this and yet they still turned to worshiping an idol!
God forbid!
And God was angry.

> **And the LORD said to Moses, “Go down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’” And the LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people. Now therefore let me alone, _that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them_, in order that I may make a great nation of you.”** [(Ex 32:7‑10 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+32/)

God had a mind to destroy them all and start a new nation with Moses.
I want to bring this all to mind so that you might remember *why* God chose *not* to destroy the Israelites.

> **But Moses implored the LORD his God and said, “O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? _Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’?_ Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’” ... And the LORD relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people.** [(Ex 32:11‑14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+32/)

"Lord, you remember what You promised to Abraham," and "Lord, what will the Egyptians say?"
Moses brought up these two reasons for God to change His mind, and, amazingly enough, God changed His mind.
Beloved in the Lord, today, on Ephiphany, we celebrate the second reason for not destroying the Israelites; the second reason is "What will the Egyptians say?"
For if God cared less about the Egyptians, He would have cared less about what the Egyptians would say.

Oh, and that was not the only time God was ready to justly kill all the Israelites.
Do you remember another time?
How about when the spies returned from spying out Canaan, the Promised Land, and the people got scared of the giants that lived there and wanted to go back to Egypt?
Again, God wanted to kill them all, but what did Moses say?

> **"Now if you kill this people as one man, then _the nations who have heard your fame_ will say, ‘It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to give to them that he has killed them in the wilderness.’"** [(Nm 14:15‑16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+14/)

Again, Moses brought up this reason for God to change His mind, and again, amazingly enough, God changed His mind.
Why? Because He wanted to show the nations *that He would save His people even though they were sinners*---*that His promise is greater than His people's sin*.
Yes, beloved in the Lord, it is His will---His underlying purpose for bringing the Israelites, His chosen people, to the Promised Land---His will is to show *all people* that He can be trusted to do what He promises---*He is the God that all nations can trust*.
The Israelites are faithless, but the LORD, their God, is faithful; let all the nations believe it!

That is God's good and gracious will revealed in the Old Testament, and today we celebrate Epiphany.
Yes, on Epiphany we remember that the Gentile wise men believe that the God of Israel can be trusted to save not only the Jews but also the Gentiles.
They are the first of the nations to come to faith that the God of Israel is *their God*, who looks with mercy on sinners.
And it is for this purpose that the Son of Mary is born, that God would show the Jews first, but also the Gentiles, that God is angry with idolatry but nevertheless comes to forgive idolatry, and all the sin that goes with it.
In fact, He comes to wipe out idolatry altogether.
The God of Israel---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---is the only true God and He is the God who comes to save sinners from the Satan's slavery.
AMEN.
