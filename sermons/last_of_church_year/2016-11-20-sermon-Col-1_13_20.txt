## First reading [Mal 3:13‑18 ESV]

[13] “Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’ [14] You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts? [15] And now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper but they put God to the test and they escape.’”

[16] Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another. The LORD paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and esteemed his name. [17] “They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in the day when I make up my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him. [18] Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.”

[13] ᾿Εβαρύνατε ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ τοὺς λόγους ὑμῶν, λέγει κύριος, καὶ εἴπατε ᾿Εν τίνι κατελαλήσαμεν κατὰ σοῦ;
[14] εἴπατε Μάταιος ὁ δουλεύων θεῷ, καὶ τί πλέον ὅτι ἐφυλάξαμεν τὰ φυλάγματα αὐτοῦ καὶ διότι ἐπορεύθημεν ἱκέται πρὸ προσώπου κυρίου παντοκράτορος;
[15] καὶ νῦν ἡμεῖς μακαρίζομεν ἀλλοτρίους, καὶ ἀνοικοδομοῦνται πάντες ποιοῦντες ἄνομα καὶ ἀντέστησαν θεῷ καὶ ἐσώθησαν.

[16] Ταῦτα κατελάλησαν οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν κύριον, ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· καὶ προσέσχεν κύριος καὶ εἰσήκουσεν καὶ ἔγραψεν βιβλίον μνημοσύνου ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ τοῖς φοβουμένοις τὸν κύριον καὶ εὐλαβουμένοις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ.
[17] καὶ ἔσονταί μοι, λέγει κύριος παντοκράτωρ, εἰς ἡμέραν, ἣν ἐγὼ ποιῶ εἰς περιποίησιν, καὶ αἱρετιῶ αὐτοὺς ὃν τρόπον αἱρετίζει ἄνθρωπος τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν δουλεύοντα αὐτῷ.
[18] καὶ ἐπιστραφήσεσθε καὶ ὄψεσθε ἀνὰ μέσον δικαίου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον ἀνόμου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ δουλεύοντος θεῷ καὶ τοῦ μὴ δουλεύοντος.

## Epistle [Col 1:13‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[13] He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, [14] in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

[15] He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. [16] For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. [17] And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. [18] And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. [19] For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, [20] and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.

------------

[13] ὃς ἐρρύσατο ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους καὶ μετέστησεν εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ, 
[14] ἐν ᾧ ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν, τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν:

[15] ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου, πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως, 
[16] ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη τὰ πάντα ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, τὰ ὁρατὰ καὶ τὰ ἀόρατα, εἴτε θρόνοι εἴτε κυριότητες εἴτε ἀρχαὶ εἴτε ἐξουσίαι: τὰ πάντα δι' αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν ἔκτισται, 
[17] καὶ αὐτός ἐστιν πρὸ πάντων καὶ τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν. 
[18] καὶ αὐτός ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλὴ τοῦ σώματος, τῆς ἐκκλησίας: ὅς ἐστιν ἀρχή, πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν, ἵνα γένηται ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτὸς πρωτεύων, 
[19] ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα κατοικῆσαι 
[20] καὶ δι' αὐτοῦ ἀποκαταλλάξαι τὰ πάντα εἰς αὐτόν, εἰρηνοποιήσας διὰ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ, [δι' αὐτοῦ] εἴτε τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς εἴτε τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 23:27‑43 ESV]

[27] And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him. [28] But turning to them Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. [29] For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’ [30] Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’ [31] For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”

[32] Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. [33] And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. [34] And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments. [35] And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!” [36] The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine [37] and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” [38] There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.”

[39] One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” [40] But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? [41] And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” [42] And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” [43] And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”

[27] Ἠκολούθει δὲ αὐτῷ πολὺ πλῆθος τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ γυναικῶν αἳ ἐκόπτοντο καὶ ἐθρήνουν αὐτόν. 
[28] στραφεὶς δὲ πρὸς αὐτὰς [ὁ] Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν, Θυγατέρες Ἰερουσαλήμ, μὴ κλαίετε ἐπ' ἐμέ: πλὴν ἐφ' ἑαυτὰς κλαίετε καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν, 
[29] ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἔρχονται ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς ἐροῦσιν, Μακάριαι αἱ στεῖραι καὶ αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν. 
[30] τότε ἄρξονται λέγειν τοῖς ὄρεσιν, Πέσετε ἐφ' ἡμᾶς, καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, Καλύψατε ἡμᾶς: 
[31] ὅτι εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν, ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ τί γένηται; 

[32] Ἤγοντο δὲ καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο σὺν αὐτῷ ἀναιρεθῆναι. 
[33] καὶ ὅτε ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τὸν καλούμενον Κρανίον, ἐκεῖ ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς κακούργους, ὃν μὲν ἐκ δεξιῶν ὃν δὲ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν. 
[34] [[ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς ἔλεγεν, Πάτερ, ἄφες αὐτοῖς, οὐ γὰρ οἴδασιν τί ποιοῦσιν.]] διαμεριζόμενοι δὲ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἔβαλον κλήρους. 
[35] καὶ εἱστήκει ὁ λαὸς θεωρῶν. ἐξεμυκτήριζον δὲ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες λέγοντες, Ἄλλους ἔσωσεν, σωσάτω ἑαυτόν, εἰ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ ἐκλεκτός. 
[36] ἐνέπαιξαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ στρατιῶται προσερχόμενοι, ὄξος προσφέροντες αὐτῷ 
[37] καὶ λέγοντες, Εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων, σῶσον σεαυτόν. 
[38] ἦν δὲ καὶ ἐπιγραφὴ ἐπ' αὐτῷ, Ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων οὗτος. 

[39] Εἷς δὲ τῶν κρεμασθέντων κακούργων ἐβλασφήμει αὐτὸν λέγων, Οὐχὶ σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός; σῶσον σεαυτὸν καὶ ἡμᾶς. 
[40] ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ ἕτερος ἐπιτιμῶν αὐτῷ ἔφη, Οὐδὲ φοβῇ σὺ τὸν θεόν, ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ; 
[41] καὶ ἡμεῖς μὲν δικαίως, ἄξια γὰρ ὧν ἐπράξαμεν ἀπολαμβάνομεν: οὗτος δὲ οὐδὲν ἄτοπον ἔπραξεν. 
[42] καὶ ἔλεγεν, Ἰησοῦ, μνήσθητί μου ὅταν ἔλθῃς εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν σου. 
[43] καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Ἀμήν σοι λέγω, σήμερον μετ' ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we have arrived to the last Sunday of the Church Year.
Yes, we will be celebrating New Year next week---a new *church* year---for we will have arrived to the season of Advent.
However, as today is the last Sunday of the *old* church year, we cast our eyes on the end of all things, when *the Day* will finally come upon mankind---the Day of Judgment---the day of Christ's return.
*The day* appears in our Old Testament reading from Malachi:

> **&ldquo;They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in _the day_ when I make up my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him. Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.&rdquo;** [(Mal&nbsp;3:17&#x2011;18)](http://www.esvbible.org/Malachi%203%3A17-18/)

In *the day*, God Himself will spare His Church as a man spares His Son who serves Him.
But also on *the day*, **you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between the one who serves God and the one who does not serve Him.**
And so, on a sobering note, beware that God *does* make distinctions between the righteous and the wicked.
And in this distinction, there will be some who are found *not* to serve God.
Making this distinction will be tricky from the outside.
In other words---this distinction of who *does* serve God and who *does not* serve God---you cannot tell from the outside:

> **&ldquo;Not everyone who says to me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On _that day_ many will say to me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?&rsquo; And then will I declare to them, &lsquo;I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.&rsquo;&rdquo;** [(Mt&nbsp;7:21&#x2011;23 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%207%3A21-23/)

There will be some, who on *that day* will have prophesying and casting out demons in the name of Jesus on their resumes who ... will *not* have done the will of our Father who art in heaven.
You cannot tell it from the outside; but God can by looking *inside*.
The Spirit searches our hearts and know what is there.

On the inside, it is written that we are created in God's image.

> **&ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&rdquo;**

> **So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.** [(Gn&nbsp;1:26&#x2011;27 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis%201%3A26-27/)

God's first creation was very good! But you know what happened. Satan lied and Adam sinned, and what became of that image of God in which he was created?
That image of God was *twisted by sin* and badly need to be straightened out.
*[Illustration]* Let me give you an example. There are pictures and videos of violence that you do not want to show other people.
When they show videos of people getting killed, they fuzz up the part of them actually getting killed and they fuzz up what their face actually looked like in death because it is awful.
You do not want people to see that, so you fuzz it out.
That is what sin has done to the image of God in which He created us.
That image of God was once so beautiful, but now it is something you better fuzz out.
The image of God was healthy and robust in Adam and Eve when they were created, but when they turned away from the Word of God and trusted instead the lies of the devil, that image was transformed from a beautiful ballerina dancing in the meadow to a man writhing on the ground in his own blood after being shot.
That is what sin has done to the image of God in which we are created.
We are better off fuzzing it up so no one can see what our sin has done to our hearts.

What Jesus warns us about concerning the Last Day is that there will be those who, on the outside, did great things that brought glory to His name who, nonetheless, did so with wicked hearts, that no matter how much they fuzzed it up, God still saw their wicked hearts.

But, beloved in the Lord, our Epistle reading says, **&ldquo;[The Son] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation,&rdquo;** and I offer to you here as interpretation of this verse that Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God, the Creator of the old creation but also the firstborn of the *new* creation.
He is the Creator of *two* creations: the Creator of heaven and earth as we know it *and* He is the Creator of His Church.
Now as the Creator of His Church, He is both God---who created sun, earth, moon, and stars and all living things---**He is before all things**---**in Him all the fullness of God is pleased to dwell**---He is both God and *man*, who was born of the virgin Mary.
And as *man*---not God---He is **the firstborn from the _dead_**, for God cannot die.

Beloved in the Lord, know who Jesus is!
He is the firstborn of the *dead*, marking Him as the Creator of His Church, His *new* creation where sin and death are conquered by the forgiveness of sins in His name!
**He is the image of the invisible God**---*the image of God fully restored in man*!
Jesus has restored that image of God in man that was so twisted by sin that it was better to fuzz it out.
Beloved in the Lord, Jesus has made you alive! He has restored the image of God in which you were created!
*The confidence of your heart alone*---that *Jesus* is the one---the God-man sent to save you from sin---that *faith alone* makes *you* the new creation!

Rejoice in your faith in Jesus!
Rejoice that you are part of Christ's new creation where everything lost by sin has been restored by the forgiveness of sins.
For without this faith, on the Last Day, you will be found lacking no matter what you have done.
But with your faith in Jesus---true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the virgin Mary, who is my Lord, who has redeemed me from sin, death, and from the power of the devil---with your faith in Jesus you will be found lacking *nothing* and will enter your heavenly home.

AMEN.
