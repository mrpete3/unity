## Old Testament [Dan. 7:9-10, 13-14 ESV]

[9] "As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat;
his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool;
his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire.
[10] A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him,
and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
[13] I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven
there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.
[14] And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him;
his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed."

## Epistle [Rev 1:4b‑8 ESV; sermon text]

[4] Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, 
[5] and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us 
and has freed us from our sins by his blood
[6] and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion 
forever and ever. Amen. [7] Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all
tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. [8] “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is 
and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

[4] Ἰωάννης ταῖς ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησίαις ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ: χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἑπτὰ πνευμάτων ἃ ἐνώπιον τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, 
[5] καὶ ἀπὸ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός, ὁ πρωτότοκος τῶν νεκρῶν καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς. Τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς καὶ λύσαντι ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ 
[6] καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς βασιλείαν, ἱερεῖς τῷ θεῷ καὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ αὐτῷ ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας [τῶν αἰώνων]: ἀμήν. 
[7] Ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν, καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν, καὶ κόψονται ἐπ' αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς. ναί, ἀμήν. 
[8] Ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ *)=ω, λέγει κύριος ὁ θεός, ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος, ὁ παντοκράτωρ.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 18:33‑37 ESV]

[33] So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” [34] Jesus 
answered, “Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?” [35] Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your 
own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?” [36] Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of 
this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.” [37] Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I 
am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world---to bear witness to the truth. Everyone 
who is of the truth listens to my voice.” 

## Introit [Ps 39:4-5a, 7-8, 12a; antiphon: 2 Peter 3:13b]

> We are looking forward to a new heaven and | a new earth,\*\
> the home of | righteousness.\
> O LORD, make me know my end and what is the measure | of my days;\*\
> let me know how fleeting | I am!\
> Behold, you have made my days a few | handbreadths,\*\
> and my lifetime is as nothing be- | fore you.\
> And now, O Lord, for what | do I wait?\*\
> My hope | is in you.\
> Deliver me from all my trans- | gressions.\*\
> Do not make me the scorn | of the fool!\
> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear | to my cry;\*\
> hold not your peace | at my tears!
