## Old Testament [Dan. 7:9-10, 13-14 ESV]

[9] "As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat;
his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool;
his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire.
[10] A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him,
and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
[13] I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven
there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.
[14] And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him;
his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed."

## Epistle [Rev 1:4b‑8 ESV; sermon text]

[4] Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, 
[5] and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us 
and has freed us from our sins by his blood
[6] and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion 
forever and ever. Amen. [7] Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all
tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. [8] “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is 
and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

[4] Ἰωάννης ταῖς ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησίαις ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ: χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἑπτὰ πνευμάτων ἃ ἐνώπιον τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, 
[5] καὶ ἀπὸ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός, ὁ πρωτότοκος τῶν νεκρῶν καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς. Τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς καὶ λύσαντι ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ 
[6] καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς βασιλείαν, ἱερεῖς τῷ θεῷ καὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ αὐτῷ ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας [τῶν αἰώνων]: ἀμήν. 
[7] Ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν, καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν, καὶ κόψονται ἐπ' αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς. ναί, ἀμήν. 
[8] Ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ *)=ω, λέγει κύριος ὁ θεός, ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος, ὁ παντοκράτωρ.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 18:33‑37 ESV]

[33] So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” [34] Jesus 
answered, “Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?” [35] Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your 
own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?” [36] Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of 
this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.” [37] Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I 
am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world---to bear witness to the truth. Everyone 
who is of the truth listens to my voice.” 

## Introit [Ps 39:4-5a, 7-8, 12a; antiphon: 2 Peter 3:13b]

> We are looking forward to a new heaven and | a new earth,\*\
> the home of | righteousness.\
> O LORD, make me know my end and what is the measure | of my days;\*\
> let me know how fleeting | I am!\
> Behold, you have made my days a few | handbreadths,\*\
> and my lifetime is as nothing be- | fore you.\
> And now, O Lord, for what | do I wait?\*\
> My hope | is in you.\
> Deliver me from all my trans- | gressions.\*\
> Do not make me the scorn | of the fool!\
> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear | to my cry;\*\
> hold not your peace | at my tears!

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I usually tell people who are depressed by the news to stop watching the news, read the Bible instead, and get up and do something productive, like pray.
Imagine the possibilities of what could happen if we reduced our consumption of news 50%, opened the Psalms, a prayer book, or our prayer list, and got busy.
I have paid attention to the news, too, but not too much just because I, too, can get sidetracked by all the details of terrible things that happen, and, frankly, I have a lot to do.
But if I may mention just one of the many terrible headlines, let it be *Jews Massacred in Pittsburgh*---people you and I would love to know and associate with and one of them, if I lived there, probably would have been my doctor.
If that were not enough to lament, in the case of this massacre, my own son Aadu was only a half mile away from the flying bullets as the blood poured from the victims onto the ground.
Aadu was that close to the massacre, and I *love* to associate with him.
That is news to get worked up over---for me.

But, beloved in the Lord, God does not leave us just hanging with nothing but the news and now "deal with it."
God leaves us with His Word, His living Word, **piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart** ([Heb 4:12](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+4:12/) ESV)---His living Word for us to hear and cling to when the waters rage around us.
You are well aware, I hope, about Satan and His devices.
There were two trees in the Garden of Eden---the real Garden of Eden where the first man and the first woman walked in Holy Matrimony.
None of us were there, but these were the first people.
God directed Moses to write about them for us that we would know where we come from, and that we would know where all the trouble came from.
For there were two trees in the Garden---the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

Where God plainly said, "Do this; don't do that," Satan was there to confuse and obscure what was clear from God's Word.

> **And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."** ([Gn 2:16‑17](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2:16/) ESV)

That was it---that one commandment was the only one with which Adam and Eve needed to be concerned.
Food was free and childbirth was to be painless.

> **Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?"** ([Gn 3:1](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:1/) ESV)

In case this was not clear to you, Satan's first approach to Eve---or to you, for that matter---is to question what God has clearly said.
But did you catch the device?
Beloved, I want you to know from God's Word what devices Satan uses when he is on the offensive.
**"Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of _any_ tree in the garden’?"**
Satan knew that God had prohibited eating only from *one* tree, but he posed his question using the word _any_ to create confusion in such a way that Eve would be tricked into responding to him.
"Of course, God let us eat of any tree _except_ that one tree."
But consider that moment---consider that opportunity to correct what Satan has clearly confused.
Is it worth it?
Is it worth responding to Satan if his approach is to confuse?
Was Eve wise to respond at all to Satan?

> **And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not surely die."** ([Gn 3:2‑4](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:2/) ESV)

Eve was foolish to keep going---at least in the way she was disposed to, for she had begun to see things Satan's way---and here we hear from the Bible the first bold-faced lie ever told to man: **"You will not surely die."**

> **"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.** ([Gn 3:1‑7](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3/) ESV)

And here we have the first terrible headline of history: *Paradise Lost*.
The economy up to that time was free food and name the animals.
After the headline, man had to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow ([Gn 3:19](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:19/) ESV)).
Childbirth up to that time had been designed by God to be painless.
(There is no record in the Bible, by the way, of any children having been born to Eve in this painless way.)
After the headline, children were born in painful labor---so painful that many women shy away from giving birth to children for fear of this pain.
If it were not for this headline, this would not even be an issue.
*Paradise Lost*---what a terrible headline.

Yet there is one wonderful headline from the Garden of Eden: *Seed of the Woman Promised*. The LORD said to the serpent,

> **"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."** ([Gn 3:15](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:15/) ESV)

The promised Seed of the Woman was to bruise Satan's head---to give him a mortal blow to keep him from harming us.
That promise was fulfilled with the birth of our Lord Jesus by the virgin Mary.

The Bible records for us that Satan approached Jesus much in the same way he approached Eve.

> **And the tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” ([Mt 4:3‑4](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+4:3/) ESV)

Beloved in the Lord, do you see the difference in Christ's response Satan and Eve's response to Satan?
"What God has said, He has said. What God has written, He has written."
Christ is victorious where Eve failed.
This, you may say, and not the wedding at Cana, is the first wonder performed by Christ: to face Satan as a man and stick to the revealed Word of God.
Satan wanted to engage Jesus' hunger; He had not eaten in *forty days*; Jesus deflected His hunger and clung to the Word of God, obedient to His Father at every step.
Money is running out among many today and you may go hungry.
Satan can easily try to engage your hunger---you need food!
Deflect your hunger and cling to God's revealed Word---cling to your Bible and you will be fed soon enough.
"What God has said, He has said. What God has written, He has written."
Just as easily as physical hunger, Satan can engage your hunger for love and physical affection.
This is where you often find yourself most vulnerable.
Deflect your hunger and cling to God's revealed Word---cling to your Bible and you will be fed soon enough.
"What God has said, He has said. What God has written, He has written."

*[Point to Crucifixion window]* Mockers of Christ will say, "Look what that got Him. He was crucified! What a disgrace!"
*[Point to the Resurrection window]* But I declare to you that Christ is risen! He is risen, indeed! Alleluia!
Not only is Christ vindicated, but all who believe in Him.
If you would trust that His bloody death on the Cross is your guarantee of life---that your sins, not His were punished on the Cross---*[Point to the altar]* I declare to you that Christ has given His very blood, His very life, for you to receive with your lips at this altar.
**"Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins."**

If Christ is risen from the dead, where is He now?

> **"I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed."** ([Dn 7:13‑14](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+7:13/) ESV)

He sits and the right hand of God, and from thence He will come to judge both the living and the dead.
He will judge us according to what God has said; He will judge us according to what God has written.
**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
