## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, when you say the words “our Father” in a Lutheran church, I would say that for everyone,
the rest of the Lord's Prayer comes up. **“Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name …”**
When you say the words “our Father” in _any Christian church_, the rest of the Lord's Prayer comes up.
When you say the words “our Father” to _any English-speaking person_, I still say it is likely that
the rest of the Lord's Prayer comes up.
For this year's Lenten sermons, we will slowly and carefully digest this prayer—the Lord's Prayer—this jewel
that our Lord Jesus gave to us to teach us to pray.

> **Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,
> Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread;
> and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;
> and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
> For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.**

You could just as well say, “my Father”—“my Father who is in heaven”—for He truly is your personal Father—after all,
He named you after Himself when He baptized you.

AMEN.

## Outline

<center>HIS ANGER IS BUT FOR A MOMENT, AND HIS FAVOR IS FOR A LIFETIME.</center>

1. If you say only the words “our Father,” almost everyone knows what follows.
    1. These may be the best-known words in the English language.
    2. You could just as well say, “my Father,” but everyone knows “our Father.”
    3. The next thing everyone knows about “our Father” is that He's in heaven.
1. Our good Father in heaven is the One we turn to in need.
    1. We remember our own good fathers: strict and loving.
    1. “His anger is but for a moment, and His favor is for a lifetime.”
    
## Notes

I've heard many speak fondly of their fathers. The ones whose fathers loved them dearly were also strict.
