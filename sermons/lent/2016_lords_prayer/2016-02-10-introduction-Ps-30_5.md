## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, when you say the words “our Father” in a Lutheran church, I would say that automatically for practically anyone, the rest of the Lord's Prayer comes up.

AMEN.

## Outline

<center>HIS ANGER IS BUT FOR A MOMENT, AND HIS FAVOR IS FOR A LIFETIME.</center>

1. If you say only the words “our Father,” almost everyone knows what follows.
    1. These may be the best-known words in the English language.
    2. You could just as well say, “my Father,” but everyone knows “our Father.”
    3. The next thing everyone knows about “our Father” is that He's in heaven.
1. Our good Father in heaven is the One we turn to in need.
    1. We remember our own good fathers: strict and loving.
    1. “His anger is but for a moment, and His favor is for a lifetime.”
    
## Notes

I've heard many speak fondly of their fathers. The ones whose fathers loved them dearly were also strict.
