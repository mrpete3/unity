## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **“Our Father who art in heaven, …** _[Pause]_ **hallowed be Thy name.”** When I said, **“Our Father who art in heaven”**—no doubt—**“hallowed be Thy name”** came to mind.
And then,

> **Thy kingdom come, …** _[Pause]_  
> **Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. …** _[Pause]_  
> **Give us this day our daily bread; …** _[Pause]_  
> **and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; …** _[Pause]_  
> **and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.**  

That is how we will break up the Lord's Prayer between now and Good Friday—petition by petition—as it is in the Catechism.

You could just as well say, “_My_ Father who is in heaven”—for He truly is your Father.
Nevertheless, there is something strange about “My Father who is in heaven” because you have
been taught to pray, **“_Our_ Father who art in heaven.”**
_Our_ Father in heaven is the God and Father of His Church; not only _your_ Father—_our_ Father.

Of course, the next thing you know about “our Father” is that He is in heaven,
and so is His Son Jesus, our Lord.
But we must confess with shame and fear that we once had a father in hell—**“the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh”** [(Eph 2:2‑3 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Ephesians%202%3A2-3/)—and for these passions we will all return to dust.
However, the Scriptures testify that our Father in heaven sent His only Son to purchase and win us from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil [(Jn 3:16)](http://www.esvbible.org/John%203%3A16/) _and in His name we trust_.
Our trust in His name, given to us in Baptism, _makes us_ children of God,
and with happy hearts we do call Him, **“Our Father.”**

What is _our Father_ like and how are we to pray to Him? Well, He might be a bit like _my Father_, for from time to time our members tell me about _my father_.
“My father was a very loving man.” “My father taught me how to sing.”
Now the father who taught his daughter to sing also told her not to put the poisoned oats
by the fence so the horses do not get into it.
(The poisoned oats were for killing prairie dogs.)
Well, this daughter put the poisoned oats away from the fence, she thought.
But later that day, four of them were dead!
Her father said, “I told you not to put the oats by the fence.” And that was it.
His anger must have burned for a moment, but his daughter never heard it.
(And she never poisoned any more horses, either.)

> **His anger is but for a moment,**  
> **and his favor is for a lifetime.**  
> **Weeping may tarry for the night,**  
> **but joy comes with the morning.**

Psalm 30, verse 5.

<center>HIS ANGER IS BUT FOR A MOMENT, AND HIS FAVOR IS FOR A LIFETIME.</center>

This is what the Scriptures reveal to us about _our Father_ in heaven to whom we pray.
His anger toward our sins is real, which Jesus absorbed on the Cross. It is over.
Now His favor toward us never ends.
Let us turn to Him in prayer confessing our sins and clinging to our Baptism,
by which we call Him **“our Father.”** _God would by these words tenderly invite us to believe
that He is our true Father, and we are His true children, so that we may with all boldness and confidence
ask Him as dear children ask their dear father_.<sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">§</a>]</sup>
AMEN.

## Outline

<center>HIS ANGER IS BUT FOR A MOMENT, AND HIS FAVOR IS FOR A LIFETIME.</center>

1. If you say only the words “our Father,” almost everyone knows what follows.
    2. You could just as well say, “my Father,” but everyone knows “our Father.”
    3. The next thing everyone knows about “our Father” is that He's in heaven.
        1. Want to forget about the father in hell.
1. Our good Father in heaven is One we turn to.
    1. We remember our own good fathers: strict and loving.
    1. “His anger is but for a moment, and His favor is for a lifetime.”
    
## Notes

I've heard many speak fondly of their fathers. The ones whose fathers loved them dearly were also strict.
