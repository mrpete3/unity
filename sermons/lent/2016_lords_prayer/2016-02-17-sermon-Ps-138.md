## Psalmody [Ps 138 ESV; sermon text]

> I give you thanks, O LORD, with | my whole heart;*  
> before the gods I | sing your praise;  
> I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your | faithfulness,*  
> for you have exalted above all things your name | and your word.  
> On the day I called, you | answered me;*  
> my strength of soul | you increased.
> All the kings of the earth shall give you thanks, | O LORD,*  
> for they have heard the words | of your mouth,  
> and they shall sing of the ways | of the LORD,*  
> for great is the glory | of the LORD.  
> For though the LORD is high, he regards the | lowly,*  
> but the haughty he knows | from afar.  
> Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you pre- | serve my life;*  
> you stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand de- | livers me.  
> The LORD will fulfill his pur- | pose for me;*  
> your steadfast love, O LORD, endures forever. Do not forsake the work | of your hands.

## Passion story [Lk 22:1‑23 ESV]

[1] Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover. [2] And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people.

[3] Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve. [4] He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. [5] And they were glad, and agreed to give him money. [6] So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.

[7] Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. [8] So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.” [9] They said to him, “Where will you have us prepare it?” [10] He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters [11] and tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ [12] And he will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare it there.” [13] And they went and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

[14] And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him. [15] And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. [16] For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” [17] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves. [18] For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” [19] And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” [20] And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. [21] But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. [22] For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!” [23] And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this.

<center>HIS ANGER IS BUT FOR A MOMENT, AND HIS FAVOR IS FOR A LIFETIME.</center>

1. If you say only the words “our Father,” almost everyone knows what follows.
    1. These may be the best-known words in the English language.
    2. You could just as well say, “my Father,” but everyone knows “our Father.”
    3. The next thing everyone knows about “our Father” is that He's in heaven.
        1. Want to forget about the father in hell.
1. Our good Father in heaven is One we turn to.
    1. We remember our own good fathers: strict and loving.
    1. “His anger is but for a moment, and His favor is for a lifetime.”
