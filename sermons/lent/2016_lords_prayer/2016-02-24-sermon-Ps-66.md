# Lenten midweek (First Petition of the Lord's Prayer)

## Announcements

## Psalmody [Ps 66 ESV; sermon text]

	[1] Shout for joy to God, all the earth;
	[2] 	sing the glory of his name;
		give to him glorious praise!
	[3] Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!
		So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.
	[4] All the earth worships you
		and sings praises to you;
		they sing praises to your name.” Selah
	
	
	[5] Come and see what God has done:
		he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man.
	[6] He turned the sea into dry land;
		they passed through the river on foot.
	There did we rejoice in him,
	[7] 	who rules by his might forever,
	whose eyes keep watch on the nations—
		let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
	
	
	[8] Bless our God, O peoples;
		let the sound of his praise be heard,
	[9] who has kept our soul among the living
		and has not let our feet slip.
	[10] For you, O God, have tested us;
		you have tried us as silver is tried.
	[11] You brought us into the net;
		you laid a crushing burden on our backs;
	[12] you let men ride over our heads;
		we went through fire and through water;
	yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.
	
	
	[13] I will come into your house with burnt offerings;
		I will perform my vows to you,
	[14] that which my lips uttered
		and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.
	[15] I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals,
		with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams;
	I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah
	
	
	[16] Come and hear, all you who fear God,
		and I will tell what he has done for my soul.
	[17] I cried to him with my mouth,
		and high praise was on my tongue.
	[18] If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
		the Lord would not have listened.
	[19] But truly God has listened;
		he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
	
	
	[20] Blessed be God,
		because he has not rejected my prayer
		or removed his steadfast love from me!
	



(Psalm 66 ESV)




## Passion story, Part 2 [Lk 22:24‑46 ESV]

[24] A dispute also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. [25] And he said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. [26] But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. [27] For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves.

[28] “You are those who have stayed with me in my trials, [29] and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, [30] that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

[31] “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, [32] but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.” [33] Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.” [34] Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.”

[35] And he said to them, “When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.” [36] He said to them, “But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. [37] For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about me has its fulfillment.” [38] And they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” And he said to them, “It is enough.”


[39] And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him. [40] And when he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.” [41] And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, [42] saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” [43] And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. [44] And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. [45] And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, 46 and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **“Our Father who art in heaven, …** _[Pause]_ **hallowed be Thy name.”**
When we pray the Lord's Prayer, the First Petition is **“Hallowed be Thy name.”**
Before we move on to the Second Petition, let us stay one more time on the First Petition: **“Hallowed be Thy name.”**
There were two main points from last week's sermon:

1. God's name and His Word go together: you know God's name when you know His Word.
2. When you know God's name, you pray. This is not an optional thing—this is something that you may or may not do or something that is on‑again-off‑again. When you know God's name _you pray_.

Tonight, we pick up from there.

> _How is God's name kept holy?_ God's name is kept holy when the Word of God is taught in its truth and purity, and we, as the children of God, also lead holy lives according to it.
Help us to do this, dear Father in heaven!
But anyone who teaches or lives contrary to God's Word profanes the name of God among us.
Protect us from this, heavenly Father!

And it is this last point that we take quite seriously: _But anyone who teaches or lives contrary to God's Word profanes the name of God among us.
Protect us from this, heavenly Father!_
Satan's lies and the world's priorities are, unfortunately, effective against our flesh.

AMEN.
