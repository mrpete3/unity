## Psalmody [Ps 94 ESV; sermon text]

> [1] O LORD, God of vengeance,  
> O God of vengeance, shine forth!  
> [2] Rise up, O judge of the earth;  
> repay to the proud what they deserve!  
> [3] O LORD, how long shall the wicked,  
> how long shall the wicked exult?  
> [4] They pour out their arrogant words;  
> all the evildoers boast.  
> [5] They crush your people, O LORD,  
> and afflict your heritage.  
> [6] They kill the widow and the sojourner,  
> and murder the fatherless;  
> [7] and they say, “The LORD does not see;  
> the God of Jacob does not perceive.”
	
> [8] Understand, O dullest of the people!  
> Fools, when will you be wise?  
> [9] He who planted the ear, does he not hear?  
> He who formed the eye, does he not see?  
> [10] He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke?  
> He who teaches man knowledge—  
> [11] the LORD—knows the thoughts of man,  
> that they are but a breath.

> [12] Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD,  
> and whom you teach out of your law,  
> [13] to give him rest from days of trouble,  
> until a pit is dug for the wicked.  
> [14] For the LORD will not forsake his people;  
> he will not abandon his heritage;  
> [15] for justice will return to the righteous,  
> and all the upright in heart will follow it.

> [16] Who rises up for me against the wicked?  
> Who stands up for me against evildoers?  
> [17] If the LORD had not been my help,  
> my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.  
> [18] When I thought, “My foot slips,”  
> your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.  
> [19] When the cares of my heart are many,  
> your consolations cheer my soul.  
> [20] Can wicked rulers be allied with you,  
> those who frame injustice by statute?  
> [21] They band together against the life of the righteous  
> and condemn the innocent to death.  
> [22] But the LORD has become my stronghold,  
> and my God the rock of my refuge.  
> [23] He will bring back on them their iniquity  
> and wipe them out for their wickedness;  
> the LORD our God will wipe them out.

## Passion story, Part 4 [Lk 23:1-25 ESV]

[1] Then the whole company of them arose and brought [Jesus] before Pilate. [2]And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” [3] And Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “You have said so.” [4] Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no guilt in this man.” [5]But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.”
[6]When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. [7]And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. [8]When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. [9]So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer. [10]The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. [11]And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. [12]And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
[13]Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, [14]and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. [15]Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. [16]I will therefore punish and release him.”
[18]But they all cried out together, “Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas”— [19]a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder. [20]Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus, [21]but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!” [22]A third time he said to them, “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him.” [23]But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. [24]So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. [25]He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will.
