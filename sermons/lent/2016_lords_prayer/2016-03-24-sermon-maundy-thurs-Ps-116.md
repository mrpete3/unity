## Old Testament [Ex 12:1‑14 ESV]
[12:1] The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, [2] “This month shall be for you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year for you. [3] Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household. [4] And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb. [5] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats, [6] and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.
[7] “Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. [8] They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it. [9] Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts. [10] And you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn. [11] In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord's Passover. [12] For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord. [13] The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
[14] “This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.



## Epistle [1Co 11:23‑32 ESV]
[23] For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, [24] and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” [25] In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” [26] For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[27] Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. [28] Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. [29] For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. [30] That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. [31] But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. [32] But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.


## Holy Gospel [Jn 13:1‑17, 31b‑35 ESV]

[13:1] Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. [2] During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, [3] Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, [4] rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. [5] Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. [6] He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” [7] Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.” [8] Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” [9] Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” [10] Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.” [11] For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”
[12] When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? [13] You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. [14] If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. [15] For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. [16] Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. [17] If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
[31b] “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. [32] If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. [33] Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’ [34] A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. [35] By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”

## Psalm [Ps 116 in its entirety; sermon text]

Put this psalm in the order of service in the place of the Introit.

> I love the LORD, because | he has heard*  
> my voice and my pleas for | mercy.  
> Because he inclined his | ear to me,*  
> therefore I will call on him as long | as I live.  
> The snares of death encompassed me;  
> the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me;  
> I suffered distress and anguish.  
> Then I called on the name of the LORD:  
> “O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!”  
> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;  
> our God is merciful.  
> The LORD preserves the simple;  
> when I was brought low, he saved me.  
> Return, O my soul, to your rest;  
> for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.  
> For you have delivered my soul from death,  
> my eyes from tears,  
> my feet from stumbling;  
> I will walk before the LORD  
> in the land of the living.  
> I believed, even when I spoke:  
> “I am greatly afflicted”;  
> I said in my alarm,  
> “All mankind are liars.”  
> What shall I render to the LORD  
> for all his benefits to me?  
> I will lift up the cup of salvation  
> and call on the name of the LORD,  
> I will pay my vows to the LORD  
> in the presence of all his people.  
> Precious in the sight of the LORD  
> is the death of his saints.  
> O LORD, I am your servant;  
> I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.  
> You have loosed my bonds.  
> I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving  
> and call on the name of the LORD.  
> I will pay my vows to the LORD  
> in the presence of all his people,  
> in the courts of the house of the LORD,  
> in your midst, O Jerusalem.  
> Praise the LORD!

## Notes

Ps 116:14. What vow will I make to the Lord for all His benefits to me?
What vow shall I make as I take up the cup of salvation and partake of the true body and blood of Jesus?
I vow to forgive my neighbor. I vow to love him.

Ps 116:15. Even death, when done by faith, pleases God.
Partaking of Christ's living body is great comfort when I am dying.
