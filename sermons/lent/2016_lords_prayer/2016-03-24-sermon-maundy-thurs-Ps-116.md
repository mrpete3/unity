## Old Testament [Ex 12:1‑14 ESV]

[12:1] The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, [2] “This month shall be for you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year for you. [3] Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household. [4] And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb. [5] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats, [6] and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.

[7] “Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. [8] They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it. [9] Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts. [10] And you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn. [11] In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord's Passover. [12] For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord. [13] The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.

[14] “This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.”


## Epistle [1Co 11:23‑32 ESV]

[23] For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, [24] and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” [25] In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” [26] For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

[27] Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. [28] Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. [29] For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. [30] That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. [31] But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. [32] But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 13:1‑17, 31b‑35 ESV]

[13:1] Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. [2] During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, [3] Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, [4] rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. [5] Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. [6] He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” [7] Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.” [8] Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” [9] Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” [10] Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.” [11] For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”

[12] When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? [13] You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. [14] If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. [15] For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. [16] Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. [17] If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
[31b] “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. [32] If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. [33] Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’ [34] A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. [35] By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”

## Psalm [Ps 116 in its entirety; sermon text]

Put this psalm in the order of service in the place of the Introit.

> I love the LORD, because | he has heard*  
> my voice and my pleas for | mercy.  
> Because he inclined his | ear to me,*  
> therefore I will call on him as long | as I live.  
> The snares of death encompassed me;  
> the pangs of Sheol laid | hold on me;*  
> I suffered distress and | anguish.  
> Then I called on the name | of the LORD:*  
> “O LORD, I pray, deliv- | er my soul!”  
> Gracious is the LORD, and | righteous;*  
> our God is | merciful.  
> The LORD preserves the | simple;*  
> when I was brought low, he | saved me.  
> Return, O my soul, | to your rest;*  
> for the LORD has dealt bountifully | with you.  
> For you have delivered my | soul from death,*  
> my eyes from tears, my feet from | stumbling;  
> I will walk be- | fore the LORD*  
> in the land of the | living.  
> I believed, even | when I spoke:*  
> “I am greatly af- | flicted”;  
> I said in | my alarm,*  
> “All mankind are | liars.”  
> What shall I render | to the LORD*  
> for all his bene- | fits to me?  
> I will lift up the cup of sal- | vation*  
> and call on the name | of the LORD,  
> I will pay my vows | to the LORD*  
> in the presence of all his | people.  
> Precious in the sight | of the LORD*  
> is the death | of his saints.  
> O LORD, I am your | servant;*  
> I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.  
> You have | loosed my bonds.  
> I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanks- | giving*  
> and call on the name | of the LORD.  
> I will pay my vows | to the LORD*  
> in the presence of all his | people,  
> in the courts of the house | of the LORD,*  
> in your midst, O Jerusalem.|  
> Praise the LORD!

## Christian Questions with Their Answers

<center><i>Prepared by Dr. Martin Luther for those who intend to go to the Sacrament</i></center>

[The “Christian Questions with Their Answers,” designating Luther as the author,
first appeared in an edition of the Small Catechism in 1551, five years after Luther's death].

After confession and instruction in the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer,
and the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, the pastor may ask,
or Christians may ask themselves these questions:

### 1. Do you believe that you are a sinner?

Yes, I believe it. I am a sinner.

### 2. How do you know this?

From the Ten Commandments, which I have not kept.

### 3. Are you sorry for your sins?

Yes, I am sorry that I have sinned against God.

### 4. What have you deserved from God because of your sins?

His wrath and displeasure, temporal death, and eternal damnation. See Romans 6:21, 23.

### 5. Do you hope to be saved?

Yes, that is my hope.

### 6. In whom then do you trust?

In my dear Lord Jesus Christ.

### 7. Who is Christ?

The Son of God, true God and man.

### 8. How many Gods are there?

Only one, but there are three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

### 9. What has Christ done for you that you trust in Him?

He died for me and shed His blood for me on the cross for the forgiveness of sins.

### 10. Did the Father also die for you?

He did not. The Father is God only, as is the Holy Spirit; but the Son is both true God and true man.
He died for me and shed his blood for me.

### 11. How do you know this?

From the holy Gospel, from the words instituting the Sacrament, and by His body and blood
given me as a pledge in the Sacrament.

### 12. What are the Words of Institution?

Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread and when He had
given thanks, He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said:
“Take eat; this is My body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me.”
In the same way also He took the cup after supper, and when He had given thanks,
He gave it to them, saying:
“Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins.
This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”

### 13. Do you believe, then, that the true body and blood of Christ are in the Sacrament?

Yes, I believe it.

### 14. What convinces you to believe this?

The word of Christ: Take, eat, this is My body; drink of it, all of you, this is My blood.

### 15. What should we do when we eat His body and drink His blood, and in this way receive His pledge?

We should remember and proclaim His death and the shedding of His blood, as He taught
us: This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.

### 16. Why should we remember and proclaim His death?

First, so that we may learn to believe that no creature could make satisfaction for our sins.
Only Christ, true God and man, could do that.
Second, so we may learn to be horrified by our sins, and to regard them as very serious. Third, so we may find joy and comfort in Christ alone, and through faith in Him be saved.

### 17. What motivated Christ to die and make full payment for your sins?

His great love for His Father and for me and other sinners, as it is written in John 14;
Romans 5; Galatians 2 and Ephesians 5.

### 18. Finally, why do you wish to go to the Sacrament?

That I may learn to believe that Christ, out of great love, died for my sin, and also learn from Him to love God and my neighbor.

### 19. What should admonish and encourage a Christian to receive the Sacrament frequently?

First, both the command and the promise of Christ the Lord. Second, his own pressing need,
because of which the command, encouragement, and promise are given.

### 20. But what should you do if you are not aware of this need and have no hunger and thirst for the Sacrament?

To such a person no better advice can be given than this:
first, he should touch his body to see if he still has flesh and blood.
Then he should believe what the Scriptures say of it in Galatians 5 and Romans 7.
Second, he should look around to see whether he is still in the world,
and remember that there will be no lack of sin and trouble, as the Scriptures say in John 15‑16 and in 1 John 2 and 5.
Third, he will certainly have the devil also around him,
who with his lying and murdering day and night will let him have no peace, within or without,
as the Scriptures picture him in John 8 and 16; 1 Peter 5; Ephesians 6; and 2 Timothy 2.

Note:  
These questions and answers are no child's play, but are drawn up with great earnestness of purpose by the venerable and devout Dr. Luther for both young and old.
Let each one pay attention and consider it a serious matter; for St. Paul writes to the Galatians in chapter six: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we will soon to partake together of the Lord's Supper, Holy Communion.
You may already be aware of the warning in our Epistle reading about receiving the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner:

> **Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.** [(1Co 11:27‑28)](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2011%3A27-28/)

That is why the Church has always been careful with Holy Communion: someone could receive Holy Communion in an unworthy manner and hurt himself.
It is my job, as your called pastor, to administer Holy Communion, the body and blood of the Lord, at this altar according to the Word of God, and that no one receive it in an unworthy manner.

It is written, **“Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.”**
“How do I examine myself?” you may ask.
This is part of what we go over in confirmation class.
(For adults I often call it *adult instruction class*.)
Confirmation class is to teach you the basics, and we use the catechism along with the Bible because the catechism boils it down to the basics.
But did you know there is a section at the end of the catechism entitled *Christian Questions with Their Answers*?
It is printed in the bulletin for you to look at.
*Christian Questions with Their Answers* is a guide for examining yourself before you receive Holy Communion. Please, take a look at it now.

“Pastor, why didn't you teach this to us in confirmation class?”
If I did not, it is on me.
So let us look at it now.

> Question number 1: *Do you believe that you are a sinner?* Yes, I believe it. I am a sinner.

> Question number 2: *How do you know this?* From the Ten Commandments, which I have not kept.

And so on.
There are twenty questions altogether with Bible passages to pray over before you receive Holy Communion.
If you have prepared yourself according to these questions, you will receive Holy Communion in a worthy manner.
This is most certainly true.

And I would like to point out that we pray the Lord's Prayer before receiving Holy Communion.
*[Point to Sermon on the Mount window]* Jesus teaches us the Lord's Prayer in the Sermon on the Mount. He says, **“Pray then like this: Our Father … And lead us not into tempataion, but deliver us from evil.**

What does this mean—**to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us**?

> **“For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.”** [(Mt 6:14‑15)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%206%3A14-15/)

Forgiveness is at the core of Holy Communion. It is implied in question 18 in *Christian Questions with Their Answers*.

AMEN.

## Stripping of the altar

[See here.](./../../../liturgy/maundy-thursday-stripping-of-the-altar.html)

## Outline

<center>FORGIVENESS IS THE GREATEST EXPRESSION OF LOVE</center>

1. Jesus commanded us on this day to love one another.
1. We practice love in many ways.
    1. But the greatest way is to live by the 5th Petition. Jesus says so in Mt 

## Notes

Fifth Petition of the Lord's Prayer

Ex 12:5. The Passover lamb can also be a goat.

Ex 12:11. Eat it in haste.

Ps 116:14. What vow will I make to the Lord for all His benefits to me?
What vow shall I make as I take up the cup of salvation and partake of the true body and blood of Jesus?
I vow to forgive my neighbor. I vow to love him.

Ps 116:15. Even death, when done by faith, pleases God.
Partaking of Christ's living body is great comfort when I am dying.

Ps 116:14, 18. **“I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people.”** This is repeated twice in the psalm.
“For we can return nothing to God except the vows of praise and confession,
for we have all things from Him and He needs nothing of our goods.”<sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">§</a>]</sup>

1Co 6:7. [7] To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?

Col 3:13‑14. [13] bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. [14] And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.
