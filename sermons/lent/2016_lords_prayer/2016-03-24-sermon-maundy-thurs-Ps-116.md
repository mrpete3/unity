Put this psalm in the order of service in the place of the Introit.

> I love the LORD, because | he has heard*  
> my voice and my pleas for | mercy.  
> Because he inclined his | ear to me,*  
> therefore I will call on him as long | as I live.  
> The snares of death encompassed me;  
> the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me;  
> I suffered distress and anguish.  
> Then I called on the name of the LORD:  
> “O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!”  
> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;  
> our God is merciful.  
> The LORD preserves the simple;  
> when I was brought low, he saved me.  
> Return, O my soul, to your rest;  
> for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.  
> For you have delivered my soul from death,  
> my eyes from tears,  
> my feet from stumbling;  
> I will walk before the LORD  
> in the land of the living.  
> I believed, even when I spoke:  
> “I am greatly afflicted”;  
> I said in my alarm,  
> “All mankind are liars.”  
> What shall I render to the LORD  
> for all his benefits to me?  
> I will lift up the cup of salvation  
> and call on the name of the LORD,  
> I will pay my vows to the LORD  
> in the presence of all his people.  
> Precious in the sight of the LORD  
> is the death of his saints.  
> O LORD, I am your servant;  
> I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.  
> You have loosed my bonds.  
> I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving  
> and call on the name of the LORD.  
> I will pay my vows to the LORD  
> in the presence of all his people,  
> in the courts of the house of the LORD,  
> in your midst, O Jerusalem.  
> Praise the LORD!

## Notes

Ps 116:14. What vow will I make to the Lord for all His benefits to me?
What vow shall I make as I take up the cup of salvation and partake of the true body and blood of Jesus?
I vow to forgive my neighbor. I vow to love him.

Ps 116:15. Even death, when done by faith, pleases God.
Partaking of Christ's living body is great comfort when I am dying.
