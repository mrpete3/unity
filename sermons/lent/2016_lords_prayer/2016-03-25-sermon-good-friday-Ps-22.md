## First Word [Lk 23:32‑37 ESV]

[32] Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. [33] And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. [34] And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments. [35] And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!” [36] The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine [37] and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”

## Second Word [Lk 23:38‑43 ESV]

[38] There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.”

[39] One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” [40] But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? [41] And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” [42] And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” [43] And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”

## Third Word [Jn 19:25‑27 ESV]

[25] Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. [26] When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” [27] Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.

## Fourth Word [Mt 27:45‑46 ESV]

[45] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. [46] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”

## Fifth Word [Jn 19:28‑29 ESV]

[28] After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), “I thirst.” [29] A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.

## Sixth Word [Jn 19:30 ESV]

[30] When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,” and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

## Seventh Word [Lk 23:44‑47 ESV]

[44] It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, [45] while the sun's light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. [46] Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” And having said this he breathed his last. [47] Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent!”

## Psalm [Ps 22 in its entirety; sermon text]

Put this psalm in the order of service in the place of the Introit.

> My God, my God, why have you for- | saken me?*  
> Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my | groaning?  
> O my God, I cry by day, but you do not | answer,*  
> and by night, but I | find no rest.  
> Yet you are | holy,*  
> enthroned on the praises of | Israel.  
> In you our fathers | trusted;*  
> they trusted, and you de- | livered them.  
> To you they cried and were | rescued;*  
> in you they trusted and were not | put to shame.  
> But I am a worm and | not a man,*  
> scorned by mankind and despised by the | people.  
> All who see me | mock me;*  
> they make mouths at me; they | wag their heads;  
> “He trusts in the LORD; let him de- | liver him;*  
> let him rescue him, for he de- | lights in him!”  
> Yet you are he who took me | from the womb;*  
> you made me trust you at my | mother's breasts.  
> On you was I cast | from my birth,*  
> and from my mother's womb you have | been my God.  
> Be not far from me, for trouble | is near,*  
> and there is | none to help.  
> Many bulls en- | compass me;*  
> strong bulls of Bashan sur- | round me;  
> they open wide their | mouths at me,*  
> like a ravening and roaring | lion.  
> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are | out of joint;*  
> my heart is like wax; it is melted with- | in my breast;  
> my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks | to my jaws;*  
> you lay me in the | dust of death.  
> For dogs en- | compass me;*  
> a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my | hands and feet—  
> I can count | all my bones—*  
> they stare and gloat | over me;  
> they divide my garments a- | mong them,*  
> and for my clothing they | cast lots.  
> But you, O LORD, do not be | far off!*  
> O you my help, come quickly | to my aid!  
> Deliver my soul | from the sword,*  
> my precious life from the power | of the dog!  
> Save me from the mouth of the | lion!*  
> You have rescued me from the horns of the wild | oxen!  
> I will tell of your name to my | brothers;*  
> in the midst of the congregation I will | praise you:  
> You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glo- | rify him,*  
> and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of | Israel!  
> For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and he has not hidden his | face from him,*  
> but has heard, when he | cried to him.  
> From you comes my praise in the great congre- | gation;*  
> my vows I will perform before those who | fear him.  
> The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall | praise the LORD!*  
> May your hearts live for- | ever!  
> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn | to the LORD,*  
> and all the families of the nations shall worship be- | fore you.  
> For kingship belongs | to the LORD,*  
> and he rules over the | nations.  
> All the prosperous of the earth eat and | worship;*  
> before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, even the one who could not keep him- | self alive.  
> Posterity shall | serve him;*  
> it shall be told of the Lord to the coming gener- | ation;  
> they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people | yet unborn,*  
> that he has | done it.

## Collect

Almighty God, graciously behold this Your family for whom our Lord Jesus was willing to be betrayed and delivered into the hands of sinful men to suffer death upon the cross; through the same Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, today was the darkest of days, yet we call it _Good Friday_.
Today was the day when Satan tried to destroy Jesus, for it is written that Satan entered into Judas [(Lk 22:3)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+22:3/).
And Judas betrayed Jesus to the Sanhedrin.
The Sanhedrin was glad and paid money to Judas;
then they sent the mob with swords and clubs to the Garden of Gethsemane and they arrested our Lord there.
Things got out of hand and it would appear that Satan had taken control of the whole situation in order to destroy our Lord.

But did not the devil already have his chance to destroy Jesus in the wilderness?
Our Lord had not eaten for 40 days—He was weak and was tempted by the devil, yet without sin.
It is written that the devil **departed from Him until an opportune time** [(Lk 4:13)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%204%3A13/).
Now is the opportune time.

The devil is after Jesus. Our Lord is taken away to the Sanhedrin and put on trial.

> **“Are you the Son of God …?”**

> **And [Jesus says] to them, “You say that I am.”**

> **Then they [say], “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.”** [(Lk 22:70‑71)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2022%3A70-71/)

He cannot deny that He is God and for that, He receives the sentence of death.

Jesus is treated horribly; what is done to Him is appalling.
Many of you have seen *The Passion of the Christ* movie, and if it portrays at all how Jesus is treated and what is done to Him—and I think it does—what the Roman soldiers do to Jesus is appalling.

_[Illustration]_ If Islamic terrorists attacked your office building like they attacked Belgium on Tuesday, that would be appalling, too.
Imagine they did, and fortunately you were not hurt.
Tragically, though, dozens were killed—their bodies torn apart.
Security cameras show that the terrorists accessed your building through the back door by the loading dock.
They wheeled in a bomb on a cart; then a blast and death and mourning. …
And you realize that *you* propped the back door open with a styrofoam cup to let yourself out for a smoke and you *never took the cup out* when you came back in.
You did it: *you let the terrorists in the building!*
Who are you appalled at now?<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">†</a>]</sup>

What do you feel when you meditate on your suffering Lord?
You are responsible; *your sin put Him there*.
Look at Him mocked, look at Him spat upon, look at Him scourged, and see Him crucified.
Your sin put Him there. I put Him there, too.

> **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?**  
> **Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?**

There He is, the utterly obedient Son forsaken by His Father.
Yet His Father remains a good Father, and He remains a good Son, and this is Good Friday.

It is good because your sins are being punished, but it is not you on the Cross.
Though it would appear that Satan has taken control of the whole situation in order to destroy our Lord, it is not our Lord that is being destroyed, but your sins.
For He is momentarily being destroyed together with your sins, but when the smoke clears, your sins will be gone and He will rise from the dead.
He bears your sins with great love for you, receiving the consequences you deserve.
He bears your sins with great love for His Father, trusting in Him to the end.

> **Save me from the mouth of the lion!**  
> **You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen!**  
> **I will tell of your name to my brothers;**  
> **in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:**  
> **…**  
> **From you comes my praise in the great congregation;**  
> **my vows I will perform before those who fear him.**  
> **The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;**  
> **those who seek him shall praise the LORD!**  
> **May your hearts live forever!**

Beloved in the Lord, may your hearts live forever by faith in Christ crucified for you! AMEN.

<center>BUT DELIVER US FROM THE EVIL ONE</center>

1. But deliver us from evil.
    1. Evil is not _bad_—evil is the _evil one_—the devil.

## Notes

Sixth and Seventh Petitions of the Lord's Prayer

Jesus' seven last words from the Cross

Lk 23:31. **“For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”**  As if to say: Learn from my martyrdom what you have merited and how you should be rewarded.<sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">§</a>]</sup>

*Look at what you did!* Jesus of Nazareth, a righteous man, nailed to a cross after He had been beaten and whipped.
If you ever neglected to push in a chair, someone may have tripped on it and fallen down.
*Look at what you did.*

If an Islamic terrorist had just exploded a bomb and killed dozens of people at the office building where you work, you would be appalled at the crime and at the perpetrator.
Fortunately, you were not hurt.
But then you find out that security cameras show that he accessed the building through the back door, which does not even have a handle for pulling it open.
And then you realize that yesterday you propped that back door open with a piece of styrofoam and you forgot to take it out and you went home for the night.
*You let the terrorist in the building by your foolishness!*
Who are you appalled at now?<sup>[<a name="id0001" href="#ftn.id0001">†</a>]</sup>
