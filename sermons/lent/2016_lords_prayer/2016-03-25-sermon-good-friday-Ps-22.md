## First Word [Lk 23:32‑37 ESV]

[32] Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. [33] And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. [34] And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments. [35] And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!” [36] The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine [37] and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”

## Second Word [Lk 23:38‑43 ESV]

[38] There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.”

[39] One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” [40] But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? [41] And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” [42] And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” [43] And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”

## Psalm [Ps 22 in its entirety; sermon text]

Put this psalm in the order of service in the place of the Introit.

> My God, my God, why have you for- | saken me?*  
> Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my | groaning?  
> O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer,  
> and by night, but I find no rest.  
> Yet you are holy,  
> enthroned on the praises of Israel.  
> In you our fathers trusted;  
> they trusted, and you delivered them.  
> To you they cried and were rescued;  
> in you they trusted and were not put to shame.  
> But I am a worm and not a man,  
> scorned by mankind and despised by the people.  
> All who see me mock me;  
> they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;  
> “He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him;  
> let him rescue him, for he delights in him!”  
> Yet you are he who took me from the womb;  
> you made me trust you at my mother's breasts.  
> On you was I cast from my birth,  
> and from my mother's womb you have been my God.  
> Be not far from me,  
> for trouble is near,  
> and there is none to help.  
> Many bulls encompass me;  
> strong bulls of Bashan surround me;  
> they open wide their mouths at me,  
> like a ravening and roaring lion.  
> I am poured out like water,  
> and all my bones are out of joint;  
> my heart is like wax;  
> it is melted within my breast;  
> my strength is dried up like a potsherd,  
> and my tongue sticks to my jaws;  
> you lay me in the dust of death.  
> For dogs encompass me;  
> a company of evildoers encircles me;  
> they have pierced my hands and feet—  
> I can count all my bones—  
> they stare and gloat over me;  
> they divide my garments among them,  
> and for my clothing they cast lots.  
> But you, O LORD, do not be far off!  
> O you my help, come quickly to my aid!  
> Deliver my soul from the sword,  
> my precious life from the power of the dog!  
> Save me from the mouth of the lion!  
> You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen!  
> I will tell of your name to my brothers;  
> in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:  
> You who fear the LORD, praise him!  
> All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him,  
> and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!  
> For he has not despised or abhorred  
> the affliction of the afflicted,  
> and he has not hidden his face from him,  
> but has heard, when he cried to him.  
> From you comes my praise in the great congregation;  
> my vows I will perform before those who fear him.  
> The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;  
> those who seek him shall praise the LORD!  
> May your hearts live forever!  
> All the ends of the earth shall remember  
> and turn to the LORD,  
> and all the families of the nations  
> shall worship before you.  
> For kingship belongs to the LORD,  
> and he rules over the nations.  
> All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship;  
> before him shall bow all who go down to the dust,  
> even the one who could not keep himself alive.  
> Posterity shall serve him;  
> it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;  
> they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn,  
> that he has done it.
