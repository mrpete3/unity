## Old Testament [Jl 2:12‑19 ESV]

> [12] “Yet even now,” declares the LORD,\
> “return to me with all your heart,\
> with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;\
> [13] 	and rend your hearts and not your garments.”\
> Return to the LORD your God,\
> for he is gracious and merciful,\
> slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love;\
> and he relents over disaster.\
> [14] Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,\
> and leave a blessing behind him,\
> a grain offering and a drink offering\
> for the LORD your God?


> [15] Blow the trumpet in Zion;\
> consecrate a fast;\
> call a solemn assembly;\
> [16] 	gather the people.\
> Consecrate the congregation;\
> assemble the elders;\
> gather the children,\
> even nursing infants.\
> Let the bridegroom leave his room,\
> and the bride her chamber.


> [17] Between the vestibule and the altar\
> let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep\
> and say, “Spare your people, O LORD,\
> and make not your heritage a reproach,\
> a byword among the nations.\
> Why should they say among the peoples,\
> ‘Where is their God?’”


> [18] Then the LORD became jealous for his land\
> and had pity on his people.\
> [19] The LORD answered and said to his people,\
> “Behold, I am sending to you\
> grain, wine, and oil,\
> and you will be satisfied;\
> and I will no more make you\
> a reproach among the nations.

## Epistle [Rm 3:21‑28 ESV]

[21] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—[22] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:
[23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.
This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

[27] Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. [28] For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 3:1‑6 ESV; sermon text]

[1] In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, [2] “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” [3] For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,

> “The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\
> ‘Prepare the way of the Lord;\
> make his paths straight.’”
	
	
[4] Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. [5] Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, [6] and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

## Introit [Ps 51:1-3, 10-12; antiphon: Ps 51:17]

> The sacrifices of God are a broken | spirit;\*\
> a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will | not despise.\
> Have mercy on me, O God, according to your | steadfast love;\*\
> according to your abundant mercy blot out my trans- | gressions.\
> Wash me thoroughly from my in- | iquity,\*\
> and cleanse me | from my sin!\
> For I know my trans- | gressions,\*\
> and my sin is ever be- | fore me.\
> Create in me a clean heart, | O God,\*\
> and renew a right spirit with- | in me.\
> Cast me not away from your | presence,\*\
> and take not your Holy Spirit | from me.\
> Restore to me the joy of your sal- | vation,\*\
> and uphold me with a willing | spirit.\

## Collect

Almighty and everlasting God, You despise nothing You have made and forgive the sins of all who are penitent. Create in us new and contrite hearts that lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness we may receive from You full pardon and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, during this Lenten season we will face our crosses:

* Tonight: Face our sin.
* March 8: Face temptation.
* March 15: Face our fears.
* March 22: Face worldliness.
* March 29: Face one another.
* April 5: Face our suffering.
* Palm Sunday: Face the road.
* Maundy Thursday: Face denial.
* Good Friday: Face death.
* Easter Sunday (with rejoicing): Face the future.

And so, for today, Ash Wednesday, we face our sin.
And let us recall what our Lord Jesus plainly says at the beginning of Luke, chapter 13.

> **There were some present at that very time who told [Jesus] about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”** [(Lk 13:1‑5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+13/)

Our Lord repeatedly warns us,
_**"Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish"**_---you will die a dreadful death.
The Word of our Lord shakes us out of our culture---out of complacency toward sin. For we are surrounded with complacency toward sin.
"I sinned. What's the big deal? Everyone makes mistakes."
However, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, may this complacency not infect us---may it not lead to our destruction, or anyone else's destruction!
For the Word of our Lord Jesus stands: **Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.**

Allow me to offer an illustration.
*[Illustration]* You may remember that a tsunami struck Thailand in 2004. There is a video on YouTube of a man standing on the beach watching the tsunami come in.
Perhaps he is frozen in fear.
He stays there on the beach, watching the waves come in, and he disappears in the wave; no doubt water fills his lungs; no doubt he dies a dreadful death.
Why did he just stand there?
Why did he not flee a dreadful death?
He stood there so long, and finally there came a time when it was too late.

Complacency is to stand there and do nothing.
Complacency toward sin is deadly; with consequences worse than standing in front of a tidal wave.
Beware, beloved in the Lord, we live among people who are complacent toward sin, and we have become complacent ourselves.
Unless we repent, we *will* likewise perish.

> **Rend your hearts and not your garments.**\
> **Return to the LORD your God,**\
> **for he is gracious and merciful,**\
> **slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love;**\
> **and he relents over disaster.**

He relents over the dreadful death in store for all unrepentant sinners.
As you stand in awe of the tidal wave of sin about to destroy you---as you brace yourself to be destroyed by the wave---He sends a preacher to tell you this:

> **For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.**

What *propitiation* means is this: That tidal wave was diverted toward Jesus.
God's anger and destruction of sin was redirected toward His own Son and *He* was destroyed.
Yes, there was a dreadful death, and it is Jesus' death.
Believe that He did it for you and when you would expect your destruction by waves, all you feel is a gentle washing and these words,
"I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
AMEN.
