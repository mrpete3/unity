## Holy Gospel [Lk 4:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

Luke 4:1-12

[1] And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness [2] for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. [3] The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” [4] And Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’” [5] And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, [6] and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. [7] If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.” [8] And Jesus answered him, “It is written,

> “‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”

[9] And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, [10] for it is written,

> “‘He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,’

[11] and

> “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”
	
[12] And Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”

[13] And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.

## Introit [Ps 91] * I didn't have the chanting notation for much of psalm 91; only for the portion that appeared in Sunday's service.

> He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High\
> will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.\
> I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress,\
> my God, in whom I trust."\
> For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler\
> and from the deadly pestilence.\
> He will cover you with his pinions,\
> and under his wings you will find refuge;\
> his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.\
> you will not fear the terror of the night,\
> nor the arrow that flies by day,\
> nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,\
> nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.\
> A thousand may fall at your side,\
> ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.\
> You will only look with your eyes\
> and see the recompense of the wicked.\
> Because you have made the LORD your | dwelling place--\*\
> the Most High, who is my | refuge--\
> no evil shall be allowed to be- | fall you,\*\
> no plague come | near your tent.\
> For he will command his angels con- | cerning you\*\
> to guard you in | all your ways.\
> On their hands they will | bear you up,\*\
> lest you strike your foot a- | gainst a stone.\
> You will tread on the lion and the | adder;\*\
> the young lion and the serpent you will trample | underfoot.\
> "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him;\
> I will protect him, because H knows my name.\
> When he calls to me, I will answer him;\
> I will be with him in trouble;\
> I will rescue him and honor him.\
> With long life I will satisfy him\
> and show him my salvation."\


## Collect

I just used the standard collect: O God from whom come all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works, give to us, your servants, that peace which the world cannot give, that our hearts may be set to obey your commandments and also that we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may live in peace and quietness; through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, as you well know, Jesus was tempted by the devil in the wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights.
For you and me, this is much more than facts to keep straight: Jesus, Satan, 40 days.
For you and I know very well what it is to be tempted by the devil, and we pray for help against the devil every time we pray,
**"Lead us not into temptation."**

> *What does this mean?* God tempts no one. We pray in this petition that God would guard and keep us so that the the devil, the world, and our sinful nature may not deceive us or mislead us into false belief, despair, and other great shame and vice. *Although we are attacked by these things*, we pray that we may finally overcome them and win the victory.

Along with protection against the devil, we pray for protection against the world and our flesh.
But the Bible reveals to us that the devil is the *prince of this world* (Eph 2:2). So, the devil works against us, using the world as his instrument.
Again, the Bible reveals to us that the devil, through lies, entices our flesh to sin against God (Gn 3:1‑6). So, the devil works against us, using our flesh as his instrument.

AMEN.
