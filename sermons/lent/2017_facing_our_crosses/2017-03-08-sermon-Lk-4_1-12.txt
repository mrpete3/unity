## Holy Gospel [Lk 4:1‑12 ESV; sermon text]

Luke 4:1-12

[1] And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness [2] for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. [3] The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” [4] And Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’” [5] And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, [6] and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. [7] If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.” [8] And Jesus answered him, “It is written,

> “‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”

[9] And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, [10] for it is written,

> “‘He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,’

[11] and

> “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”
	
[12] And Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”

[13] And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.

* Sermon hymn: _TLH_ 402 _O God, Forsake Me Not_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, as you well know, Jesus was tempted by the devil in the wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights.
He faced His temptation. How will you and I face ours?
We know very well what it is to be tempted by the devil, and we pray for help against the devil every time we pray,
**"Lead us not into temptation."**

> *What does this mean?* God tempts no one. We pray in this petition that God would guard and keep us so that the the devil, the world, and our sinful nature may not deceive us or mislead us into false belief, despair, and other great shame and vice. *Although we are attacked by these things*, we pray that we may finally overcome them and win the victory.

The devil, the world, and our sinful nature---or, if you learned it this way: the devil, the world, and our flesh---these three seek to deceive us and mislead us into temptation, where we are tempted to sin.

Is it a sin to be tempted? Have you sinned by the mere fact that you were tempted? No.
Unfortunately, however, you are stuck with your flesh---you have not yet died and been resurrected with a brand new flesh that is not infected with sin.
Until then, you are stuck with your flesh, which is infected with sin, and because of your flesh---because of your sinful nature---you are weak.
You have a weakness for sin so that when someone hurts you, you think of taking revenge.
You have a weakness for sin so that when you have a need, you turn to money first, and God second.
By virtue of your flesh, you are so weak that you *cannot help* but be tempted 24/7 in a myriad of ways---there must be thousands, if not millions of ways, to be tempted.
But if you are tempted---no, you have not sinned ... yet.

To sin is to give in to the temptation and try to get money any way you can.
Your sin will not stop at greed---just ask Judas.
(By the grace of the Holy Spirit, may you never have the opportunity to ask Judas.)
To sin is to give into the temptation and harbor a grudge.
Given your ill will against your enemy, it is only a matter of time until you take action---not explaining something about him in the kindest way, perhaps.
Your sin will not stop at breaking the 8th Commandment---it will continue and you will be engulfed in sin because you held a grudge.

The world in which you live is a playground for sin.
If you remember going to the playground as a child, the normal thing to do was play in the sandbox with the other kids---dig a hole or pretend that there is a little city there where you can play in a make-believe world.
That was normal and most kids did it.
The Bible reveals to us that the devil is the *prince of this world* (Eph 2:2); it is he, the devil, who set the expectations of the world---what is expected to be normal and acceptable.
What is normal and acceptable to the devil is lying and deceiving.
Among those who are considered leaders of the world---successful people---lying and cheating is the normal thing.
And again, once you cheat, you will not stop at that.
You will continue and probably get into stealiing and sins against marriage, and *still* look like a success in the playground of the world.

So, the devil works against us, using the world as his instrument.
Again, the Bible reveals to us that the devil, through lies, entices our flesh to sin against God (Gn 3:1‑6). So, the devil works against us, also using our flesh as his instrument.
Christ's temptation in the wilderness, beloved in the Lord, is of great comfort to us because Jesus was offered success in the world and he turned it *flat down*.

> **“It is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”**

Jesus' flesh---weak human flesh like ours, but not infected with sin---was weakened by 40 days of hunger, and he stood up to the devil and said,

> **“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’”**

You and I do not live by bread alone.
You and I certainly do not live by whatever it is that our flesh craves.
Do not be mistaken: in the world, there are people running all over the place living by whatever their flesh craves.
But within the world, there is an invisible Church---true believers in Christ in every place and in every denomination.
They have been baptized by Jesus and have been given the Holy Spirit (Ac 2:38) so that they can even believe in Jesus at all---that by the name of Jesus all their sins were forgiven at the Cross.
But in the heart where the Holy Spirit rules, as St. Paul so carefully teaches, there the flesh is drowned in Baptism.

> *What does such baptizing with water indicate?* It indicates that the old Adam in us should by daily contrition and repentance be drowned and die with all sins and evil desires, and that a new man should daily emerge and arise to live before God in righteousness and purity forever.

> *Where is this written?* St. Paul writes in Romans, chapter six: **"We were therefore buried with Him through Baptism into death in order that, just a Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we may live a new life"** (Rm 6:4).

Beloved in the Lord, face temptation with your Baptism!
Is your Baptism real? Is temptation real?
Face temptation with your Baptism!
Christ baptized you (Col 2:11‑12). He saved you from this dying world when He baptized you.
You have nothing to do with the satanic expectations of the world; you are safe in the ark of the Holy Christian Church.
Here, the flesh is drowned daily and the Holy Spirit reigns.
At the moment of your temptation, please---I implore you---remember your Baptism and pray for the Holy Spirit as Jesus taught you to pray.
I would recommend praying Psalms 6, 32, and 38 as well---the Holy Spirit will strengthen you through these psalms---6, 32, and 38.
(I may help to know that 32+6=38.)

You may have heard the expression, "Pain is weakness leaving the body."
When you remember your Baptism and pray for the Holy Spirit, you may experience serious emotional pain; this kind of pain is also weakness leaving the body---it is the weakness of the flesh leaving the body.
You will not be perfected in this earthly life, but you will be strengthened to face a blessed death with ample strength to cling to Jesus in your final hour.

AMEN.
