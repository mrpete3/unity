## Holy Gospel [Is 41:8‑13 ESV; sermon text]

[8] But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
[9] you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, “You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off”;
[10] fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
	
	
[11] Behold, all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.
[12] You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.
[13] For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, “Fear not, I am the one who helps you.”

## Introit [Ps 46]

> God is our ref- | uge and strength,*
> a very present help in | trouble.
> Therefore we will not fear though the | earth gives way,*
> though the mountains be moved into the heart | of the sea,
> though its waters | roar and foam,*
> though the mountains tremble at its | swelling.
> There is a river whose streams make glad the cit- | y of God,*
> the holy habitation of the | Most High.
> God is in the midst of her; she shall | not be moved;*
> God will help her when | morning dawns.
> The nations rage, the kingdoms | totter;*
> he utters his voice, the | earth melts.
> The LORD of hosts is | with us;*
> the God of Jacob is our | fortress.
> Come, behold the works | of the LORD,*
> how he has brought desolations | on the earth.
> He makes wars cease to the end | of the earth;*
> he breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the chariots | with fire.
> “Be still, and know that | I am God.*
> I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted | in the earth!”
> The LORD of hosts is | with us;*
> the God of Jacob is our | fortress. 


## Collect
I just used the regular one from Sunday Vespers: O God from whom come all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works, give to us, your servants, that peace which the world cannot give, that our hearts may be set to obey your commandments and also that we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may live in peace and quietness; through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
