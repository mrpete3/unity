## Holy Gospel [Is 41:8‑13 ESV; sermon text]

[8] But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
[9] you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, “You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off”;
[10] fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
	
	
[11] Behold, all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.
[12] You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.
[13] For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, “Fear not, I am the one who helps you.”

## Introit [Ps 46]

	[1] God is our refuge and strength,
		a very present help in trouble.
	[2] Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,
		though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,
	[3] though its waters roar and foam,
		though the mountains tremble at its swelling. Selah
	
	
	[4] There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
		the holy habitation of the Most High.
	[5] God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;
		God will help her when morning dawns.
	[6] The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;
		he utters his voice, the earth melts.
	[7] The LORD of hosts is with us;
		the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
	
	
	[8] Come, behold the works of the LORD,
		how he has brought desolations on the earth.
	[9] He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;
		he breaks the bow and shatters the spear;
		he burns the chariots with fire.
	[10] “Be still, and know that I am God.
		I will be exalted among the nations,
		I will be exalted in the earth!”
	[11] The LORD of hosts is with us;
		the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah (ESV)

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, our reading tonight is from Isaiah, chapter 41.

> **But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend.**

Does a verse like this help you face your fears? It should, for it reveals that Good operates on friendship, and *what a friend we have in Jesus*.

In adult Bible study on Sunday mornings, we have repeatedly.

If God looks at the unbelieving Jews with favor because of His friendship with Abraham, how much more does He look with favor on us, who revere His Son Jesus as our Redeemer?

> **You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off.**

> **Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.**

> 

AMEN.
