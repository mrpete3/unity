## Holy Gospel [Mt 6:19‑24 ESV; sermon text]

[19] “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,
[20] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. [21] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

[22] “The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, [23] but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!

[24] “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, identity theft ... cybersecurity.
These words cause quite a bit of concern these days.
It boils down to this: will that money sitting in the bank be there when you need it?
Someone may steal your Social Security number; God forbid, get your bank account number and routing number; and watch out!
All that money you worked so hard to save could be gone in an electronic instant.
We pray for our heavenly Father to protect us from thieves, but even then the thieves may steal what we have.

What does Jesus say about this?

> **"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where [identity] thieves break in and steal."**

He plainly tells us not to lay up earthly treasures because of the risk of having it stolen or depreciate in value.
"Don't do it."
What if no one broke into your bank account but you invested your money in the stock market?
Will that money sitting in the stock market be there when you need it?
Again, maybe not.
The stock market is so nebulous that we have no idea whether someone stole our money or not---it simply is not there.

It is not a sin to want to put what we have of value in a safe place.
The question is, "What is that safe place?"

> **But lay up for yourselves treasures in _heaven_, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.**

> **“The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”** [(Mt 13:31‑32 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+13/)

Think of the kingdom-of-heaven mustard seed---an investment that God made in you.
Or think of it even as a tiny godly act you made with your newly given faith: "I will seek the kingdom of heaven over all things."
That seed was sown when the Gospel---the forgiveness of sins in Jesus' name---was preached to you and the Holy Spirit gave you the faith to believe it---it could have happened in your mother's womb like it did with John the Baptist [(Lk 1:15, 41)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1/), it could have happened when you were a child---it happened; that is what matters.
Jesus baptized you, marking you as a Christian.
Look at what that kingdom-of-heaven seed grows into!
**It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.**

Beloved in the Lord, whatever is invested in the kingdom of heaven is an aggressive investment that always yields.
You may be familiar with aggressive investments in the stock market that have succeeded, making people rich.
The problem is that just as many people were made poor.
*No one* is made poor by investing in the kingdom of heaven.
Every investment grows from mustard seed to tree just as Christ our Lord has promised.

Christ's final word is this:

> **"Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."** [(Mt 6:33 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6/)

Seek first the kingdom of heaven, and then you will rejoice in your mustard seed growing into a tree *plus* all those things that you stand to lose in this world---you will have!
Face worldliness with your citizenship in heaven.
AMEN.
