## Holy Gospel [Mt 5:43‑48 ESV; sermon text]

[43] “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ [44] But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, [45] so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. [46] For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? [47] And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? [48] You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

[43] Ἠκούσατε ὅτι ἐρρέθη, Ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου καὶ μισήσεις τὸν ἐχθρόν σου. 
[44] ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν, ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν καὶ προσεύχεσθε ὑπὲρ τῶν διωκόντων ὑμᾶς, 
[45] ὅπως γένησθε υἱοὶ τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς, ὅτι τὸν ἥλιον αὐτοῦ ἀνατέλλει ἐπὶ πονηροὺς καὶ ἀγαθοὺς καὶ βρέχει ἐπὶ δικαίους καὶ ἀδίκους. 
[46] ἐὰν γὰρ ἀγαπήσητε τοὺς ἀγαπῶντας ὑμᾶς, τίνα μισθὸν ἔχετε; οὐχὶ καὶ οἱ τελῶναι τὸ αὐτὸ ποιοῦσιν; 
[47] καὶ ἐὰν ἀσπάσησθε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν μόνον, τί περισσὸν ποιεῖτε; οὐχὶ καὶ οἱ ἐθνικοὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ποιοῦσιν; 
[48] Ἔσεσθε οὖν ὑμεῖς τέλειοι ὡς ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος τέλειός ἐστιν.

## Introit [Ps 75]

> [1] We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your | name is near.\*\
> We recount your | wondrous deeds.\
> [2] “At the set time that | I appoint\*\
> I will judge with | equity.\
> [3] When the earth totters, and all its in- | habitants,\*\
> it is I who keep steady its | pillars.\
> [4] I say to the boastful, | ‘Do not boast,’\*\
> and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift | up your horn;\
> [5] do not lift up your | horn on high,\*\
> or speak with | haughty neck.’”\
> [6] For not from the east or | from the west\*\
> and not from the wilderness comes | lifting up,\
> [7] but it is God who executes | judgment,\*\
> putting down one and lifting up an- | other.\
> [8] For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours | out from it,\*\
> and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down | to the dregs.\
> [9] But I will declare it for- | ever;\*\
> I will sing praises to the God of | Jacob.\
> [10] All the horns of the wicked I will | cut off,\*\
> but the horns of the righteous shall be | lifted up.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, last week we faced worldiness; tonight we face each other.
Tonight we confess that we are not all friends but sometimes---and far too often---we are enemies.
Our Lord Jesus knows this, and tells us clearly and memorably, **"Love your enemies."**
If I were to venture to guess, I would say these words are universally recognized---right up there with the Lord's Prayer---words that everyone has heard:  **Love your enemies.**
And if I were to venture to guess, I would also say that most who recoginize these words also know who said them: Jesus Christ.
Everyone knows who Jesus Christ is and they know He said, **"Love your enemies."**
And, finally, if I were to venture to guess, I would say that everyone who thinks about these words says, "Really? Love my enemy?"

Think about what it has cost *not* to love our enemies.
Again, I would venture to guess that every war started with an offense---someone did someone to *make* and enemy---probably a real sin committed by one party against another.
Now that there were to parties at enmity with one another, he offended party responded in kind, in some way, not with love.
The offended party marked the offender not for love but for some form of retribution, *to teach them a lesson*, so to speak.
The did not get better; the conflict escalated, escalated until there was a war.
And what did it cost?
Families are broken up.
And what did it cost?
Relationships are broken up.
And what did it cost?
That is what it has cost *not* to love our enemies.

Nevertheless, did not Jesus teach us, **"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you"**?
Yet these words are universally known---they have been universally known for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Think of it: this teaching of Jesus, **"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,"** went viral over a thousand years ago before the Internet.

Beloved in the Lord, it is one thing to know these words.
It is another one to *know the one* who spoke these words.
The only reason that relationships are still fractured today, families fall apart today, the world still goes to war today is not that no one has heard **"Love your enemies,"** it is that someone did not *know the one* who spoke these words.
He knows His name is Jesus, but he does not know that *Jesus* means *Savior*---*his* Savior by the ... forgiveness of sins.
To *begin* to know Jesus is to confess that I am or have been Jesus' enemy.
For when I sin, I defy God to His face and make him my enemy.
God could retaliate with a good reason, but He has loved me, His enemy.
God who loves me, His enemy, is none other than Jesus Himself.

He proved it on the Cross.
He has every reason to tell me, **"Love your enemies"**---He did it for me.
AMEN.
