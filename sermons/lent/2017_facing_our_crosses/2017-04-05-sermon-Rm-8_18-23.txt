## Epistle [Rm 8:18‑23 ESV; sermon text]

[18] For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. [19] For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. [20] For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope [21] that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. [22] For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. [23] And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

[18] Λογίζομαι γὰρ ὅτι οὐκ ἄξια τὰ παθήματα τοῦ νῦν καιροῦ πρὸς τὴν μέλλουσαν δόξαν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι εἰς ἡμᾶς. 
[19] ἡ γὰρ ἀποκαραδοκία τῆς κτίσεως τὴν ἀποκάλυψιν τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ θεοῦ ἀπεκδέχεται: 
[20] τῇ γὰρ ματαιότητι ἡ κτίσις ὑπετάγη, οὐχ ἑκοῦσα ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸν ὑποτάξαντα, ἐφ' ἑλπίδι 
[21] ὅτι καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ κτίσις ἐλευθερωθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς δουλείας τῆς φθορᾶς εἰς τὴν ἐλευθερίαν τῆς δόξης τῶν τέκνων τοῦ θεοῦ. 
[22] οἴδαμεν γὰρ ὅτι πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις συστενάζει καὶ συνωδίνει ἄχρι τοῦ νῦν: 
[23] οὐ μόνον δέ, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτοὶ τὴν ἀπαρχὴν τοῦ πνεύματος ἔχοντες ἡμεῖς καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς στενάζομεν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπεκδεχόμενοι, τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν τοῦ σώματος ἡμῶν.

## Introit [Ps 6]

> [1] O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger,\
> nor discipline me in your wrath.\
> [2] Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing;\
> heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled.\
> [3] My soul also is greatly troubled.\
> But you, O LORD—how long?

> [4] Turn, O LORD, deliver my life;\
> save me for the sake of your steadfast love.\
> [5] For in death there is no remembrance of you;\
> in Sheol who will give you praise?

> [6] I am weary with my moaning;\
> every night I flood my bed with tears;\
> I drench my couch with my weeping.\
> [7] My eye wastes away because of grief;\
> it grows weak because of all my foes.

> [8] Depart from me, all you workers of evil,\
> for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.\
> [9] The LORD has heard my plea;\
> the LORD accepts my prayer.\
> [10] All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;\
> they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.
