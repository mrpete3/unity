## Epistle [Rm 8:18‑23 ESV; sermon text]

[18] For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. [19] For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. [20] For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope [21] that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. [22] For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. [23] And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

[18] Λογίζομαι γὰρ ὅτι οὐκ ἄξια τὰ παθήματα τοῦ νῦν καιροῦ πρὸς τὴν μέλλουσαν δόξαν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι εἰς ἡμᾶς. 
[19] ἡ γὰρ ἀποκαραδοκία τῆς κτίσεως τὴν ἀποκάλυψιν τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ θεοῦ ἀπεκδέχεται: 
[20] τῇ γὰρ ματαιότητι ἡ κτίσις ὑπετάγη, οὐχ ἑκοῦσα ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸν ὑποτάξαντα, ἐφ' ἑλπίδι 
[21] ὅτι καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ κτίσις ἐλευθερωθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς δουλείας τῆς φθορᾶς εἰς τὴν ἐλευθερίαν τῆς δόξης τῶν τέκνων τοῦ θεοῦ. 
[22] οἴδαμεν γὰρ ὅτι πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις συστενάζει καὶ συνωδίνει ἄχρι τοῦ νῦν: 
[23] οὐ μόνον δέ, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτοὶ τὴν ἀπαρχὴν τοῦ πνεύματος ἔχοντες ἡμεῖς καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς στενάζομεν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπεκδεχόμενοι, τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν τοῦ σώματος ἡμῶν.

## Introit [Ps 6]

> [1] O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger,\
> nor discipline me in your wrath.\
> [2] Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing;\
> heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled.\
> [3] My soul also is greatly troubled.\
> But you, O LORD—how long?

> [4] Turn, O LORD, deliver my life;\
> save me for the sake of your steadfast love.\
> [5] For in death there is no remembrance of you;\
> in Sheol who will give you praise?

> [6] I am weary with my moaning;\
> every night I flood my bed with tears;\
> I drench my couch with my weeping.\
> [7] My eye wastes away because of grief;\
> it grows weak because of all my foes.

> [8] Depart from me, all you workers of evil,\
> for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.\
> [9] The LORD has heard my plea;\
> the LORD accepts my prayer.\
> [10] All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;\
> they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord,
to me, Ash Wednesday seems like a long time ago.
You may recall that we have faced many things since Ash Wednesday:

* On Ash Wednesday, we faced our sin as we would face a tidal wave, standing on the beach, with no more to expect than a dreadful death by drowning.
* On March 8, we faced temptation, remembering that Jesus did not eat for 40 days when He was tempted by the devil. His flesh craved food, but, full of the Holy Spirit, He still would not yield to Satan. You and I were given the Spirit by our Baptism. Jesus has baptized us and given us the same Spirit with which to face temptaion. Face temptation with your Baptism!
* On March 15, we faced our fears not alone, but with God, our closest friend.
* On March 22, we faced worldliness considering our investment in the kingdom of God---an investment given to us when our heavenly Father brought us to His Son, that we believe in Him---a small mustard-seed investment of faith that grows into a tree of which birds can take advantage and build their nests---an investment that thieves cannot steal and moth and rust cannot destroy.
* Last week, we faced one another; not as the world, that holds a grudge, but as citizens of Christ's kingdom, where wrongs are not remembered and we, in fact, love our enemies and pray for them.
* Today we face our suffering.
* On Palm Sunday we face the road.
* On Maundy Thursday we face denial.
* On Good Friday we Face death.
* On Easter Sunday we face the future *with joy*.

Though the weather today is nice, and on a day like today and it easy to be buoyant, let us nevertheless face our sufferings.
We associate personal experience with the words we hear: mother, father, birthday.
Something happened to you---something you remember.
*Suffering*.
Just mention the word and memories walk right in;
maybe your own suffering; maybe you have seen someone else suffer,
but I bet it was a personal experience.

I have bad news for you, but maybe not that bad: your suffering has not ended.
So, it is better not to pretend that it will not come---it is better not to deny: your suffering will come.
Yet our dear Lord Jesus has said, and we all know, these words: **"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me"** [(Lk 9:23 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+9/).
Without saying the word *suffering*, we know that Jesus speaks about suffering for He says the word *cross*.
Beloved in the Lord, between now and Good Friday, the Cross gets bigger and bigger.

Your may be suffering for your own fault.
Remember David, of whom God Himself says, **"My servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes"** [(1Ki 4:18 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+14/).

AMEN.
