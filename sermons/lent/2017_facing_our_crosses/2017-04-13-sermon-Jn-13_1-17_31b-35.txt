## Old Testament [Ex 12:1‑14 ESV]

[1] The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, [2] “This month shall be for you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year for you. [3] Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household. [4] And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb. [5] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats, [6] and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.

[7] “Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. [8] They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it. [9] Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts. [10] And you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn. [11] In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the LORD's Passover. [12] For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. [13] The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.

[14] “This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.

## Epistle [1Co 11:23‑32 ESV]

[23] For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, [24] and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” [25] In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” [26] For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

[27] Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. [28] Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. [29] For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. [30] That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. [31] But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. [32] But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 13:1‑17, 31b‑35 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. [2] During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, [3] Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, [4] rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. [5] Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. [6] He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” [7] Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.” [8] Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” [9] Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” [10] Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.” [11] For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”

[12] When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? [13] You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. [14] If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. [15] For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. [16] Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. [17] If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.

...


[31b] Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. [32] If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. [33] Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’ [34] A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. [35] By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”

## Collect

O Lord, in this wondrous Sacrament You have left us a remembrance of Your passion. Grant that we may so receive the sacred mystery of Your body and blood that the fruits of Your redemption may continually be manifest in us; for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, on this day, Maundy Thursday, our Lord Jesus is one day away from hanging His sacred head in death on His Cross---giving up His life in punishment for our sins---dying on *our* Cross in *our* place. God be praised!
On this day, Maundy Thursday, He knows what is coming.

Jesus performs two glorious events for us on this day:

* First, He gives us the Lord's Supper.
* Second, He washes His disciples' feet and gives us the commandment to love one another.

Today is named after this very *commandment*---*mandate*---*maundy*---to love one another: Maundy Thursday.
Today is that day.

But Jesus also suffers two great injustices on this day:

* First, He is betrayed by Judas.
* Second, He is denied by Peter.

What harm had He ever done to them to deserve their denial and betrayal?
Beloved in the Lord, _**our Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed**_---betrayed *and* denied---tonight is the night.
I invite you to ponder nothing more than that on such a night, our Lord is disposed to love us through through our betrayals and denials.
On this night, He gave us the Lord's Supper and He washed the very disciples' feet who were about to betray Him and deny Him, knowing full well what they were about to do.
The betrayal and denial of Jesus by Peter and Judas must have hurt Jesus *personally* and *emotionally*.
Tomorrow He will also suffer physically.

Think of what you know about yourself when you are emotionally fragile because of denial or betrayal.
Chances are you are depressed, drained.
This is what our Lord suffers this day at the hands of His two friends, Judas and Peter.
Even when Judas comes with the temple guard to arrest Jesus, Jesus tells him, **"_Friend_, do what you came to do"** [(Mt 26:50 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+26/).

We focus on our Lord's suffering at the hands of sinners realizing that it is not Judas's and Peter's fault that Jesus is distressed: you and I put Him though it.
We acknowledge the cosmic reality that God foreknew our sin.
For every time we pursue that which is not from God, every time we reject what God plainly tells us and follow Satan's lie instead, every time we dishonor God even in our thoughts, we pile our insults high before His holy throne.
And God knew it before we were created!
God will not let it pile up. He will act.
If you despised your neighbor and piled your refuse in his yard, you could not offend him more than by what you have done with your sins to God.
He will act.

> **For our sake he made _[His Son]_ to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.** [(2Co 5:21 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+5/)

In other words, God makes *His Son* clean up *our mess*.
He does not say, "Jesus will clean it up, but you have to pay Me back later."
He tells His Son, "Do this for the sinners I love."
And Jesus answers, "Yes, Father. You know I love you; I love them, too."
His cleaning of our mess involves being betrayed.
His cleaning of our mess involves being denied.
His cleaning of our mess involves being falsely accused and sentenced to die.
His cleaning of our mess involves doing no wrong yet being mocked and assaulted.
His cleaning of our mess involves being put to death while those who hate Him deride Him: **"He saved others; he cannot save himself"** [(Mt 27:42 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+27/).
*A monumental pile of God's wrath poured out on Jesus, the sinners' substitute.*
He takes out all the trash from in front of God's holy throne and picks every last piece out of the grass.
Then He landscapes the yard and invites you in to supper.

Really, He invites you in to supper! Won't you come in?
He invites you into His Church to receive Holy Communion.
Rejoice in the yard where there is no trace of your sin.
Rejoice in the forgiveness He gives to you.
Rejoice in the righteousness He gives you---His body and blood is yours for the forgiveness of your sins.
AMEN.

## Notes

Jesus' being denied by Peter and betrayed by Judas are the bitter herbs He ate for Passover.

Mt 10:32‑33. Everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
