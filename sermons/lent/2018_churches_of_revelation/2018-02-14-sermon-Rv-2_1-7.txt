## Reading [Rv 2:1‑7 ESV; sermon text]


[1] “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‘The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.

[2] "‘I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false. [3] I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary. [4] But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. [5] Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. [6] Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. [7] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’"

## Introit [Ps 98:1-3]

> Sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done marvelous things;\*\
> His right hand and His holy arm have worked salvation for him.\
> The Lord has made His salvation known and revealed His righteousness to the nations.\*\
> He has remembered His love and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.\

## Collect

O Jesus, Lord of the church, I am in danger every day of leaving You, my first love. Deliver and protect me from all that threatens my faith. Give me courage to overcome temptation. Help me to trust You daily that I might ever eat from the tree of life in the paradise of God. In Your holy name, I pray.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
For those of you who read red-letter Bibles, you know that the very words from the mouth of our Lord Jesus are in red letters, like

> **"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.**\
> **Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.**\
> **Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."** [(Mt 5:3‑5 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+5&version=ESV)

These words you will find printed in red in your red-letter Bible, and you will find that much of the Gospels---Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John---are in red---the very words of our Lord Jesus Christ.

But do not forget Revelation!

* Ephesus
* Smyrna
* Pergamum
* Thyatira
* Sardis
* Philadelphia
* Laodicea

AMEN.
