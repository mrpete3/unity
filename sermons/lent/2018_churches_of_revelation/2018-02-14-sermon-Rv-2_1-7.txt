## First Lesson [Gn 3:21‑23]

## Epistle lesson [Rv 2:1‑7 ESV; sermon text]


[1] “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‘The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.

[2] "‘I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false. [3] I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary. [4] But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. [5] Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. [6] Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. [7] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’"

## Holy Gospel [Jn 15:9‑17]

## Collect

O Jesus, Lord of the church, I am in danger every day of leaving You, my first love. Deliver and protect me from all that threatens my faith. Give me courage to overcome temptation. Help me to trust You daily that I might ever eat from the tree of life in the paradise of God. In Your holy name, I pray.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of Him. Even so. Amen. "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty"** [(Rv 1:4‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

For those of you who read red-letter Bibles, you know that the very words from the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ are in red letters, like

> **"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.**\
> **Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.**\
> **Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."** [(Mt 5:3‑5 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+5&version=ESV)

These are Christ's own words---these words are printed in red in your red-letter Bible.
And you will find that many passasges in the Gospels---Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John---many passages are in red---the very words of our Lord Jesus Christ.
That is why we stand for the Holy Gospel---to give honor to the very words of our Lord Jesus Christ.

But do not forget Revelation!

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Who is it speaking to the apostle John?
None other than the Lord---none other than our Lord Jesus Christ.

> **Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.**
  
> **When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, "Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this. As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."** [(Rv 1:12‑20 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Yes, these are red letters in the book of Revelation---the very last revealed words in the Bible from the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He has a message for the seven churches: for Ephesus, for Smyrna, for Pergamum, for Thyatira, for Sardis, for Philadelphia, and for Laodicea.
We will take these messages as written for us.
And tonight, we hear the message of our Lord Jesus Christ to the church in Ephesus.

> **"‘I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary."**

Our Lord tells the Christians in Ephesus that they are doing well by not bearing with those who are evil and have tested the teaching of false apostles.
We do not know what the false apostles are, but false teachers have come to Ephesus, and the Ephesians did not put up with them---good for them!

On a church historical note, there was what is known as *the Council of Ephesus* held in Ephesus not in the year A.D. 90---around the time St. John wrote Revelation---but in the year A.D. 431, approximately 140 years later.
Let us take this opportunity to show an example of a false teacher who was tested and found to be false.
The Council of Ephesus, in A.D. 431 condemned a heretic named *Nestorius*, and church history books call his teaching *Nestorianism*.
Have you ever heard of Nestorianism?
Nestorianism was taught around the year A.D. 430 by a false teacher named *Nestorius*, who was *the Archbishop of Constantinople*---Nestorius was a very well-known pastor and Christian leader.
But Nestorius taught this about Christ: that what is God about Christ and what is man about Christ *cannot mix*.

For example, God is everywhere---we say He is *omnipresent*---God is everywhere.
Nestorius would say, if he could see Jesus on the street, "Look, there is Jesus walking down the street," but he would *refuse* to say, "Look, there is *God* walking down the street."
You cannot be God, who is everywhere, and be walking down the street, so that others can recognize you like any other man, at the same time---what is God about Christ and what is man about Christ cannot mix.

The most famous example is this: God cannot be born like one of His creatures.
Nestorius would say, if he saw Mary pregnant with Jesus, "Look there is Jesus in Mary's womb," but he would refuse to say, "Look, there is *God* in Mary's womb"---what is God about Christ and what is man about Christ cannot mix.
The Council of Ephesus condemned Nestorius as a heretic in A.D. 431 and said that Mary is indeed the *God‑bearer*---yes, that *is* God in Mary's womb;
and that is what we believe when we celebrate Christmas and confess Jesus to be *God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, ... and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary and was made man*.
We wonder at the mystery of Christ being 100% God and 100% man at the same time and confess it to be true.

For how could a Nestorian believe that God died on the Cross for our sins.
Though we believe God cannot die, we are in awe that, in fact, He *did* die---He voluntarily gave Himself up to die as payment for our sins.

The Ephesians hold to right teaching, but our Lord Jesus calls them out and points at the trouble they have gotten themselves into:

> **But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.**

Here is our Lenten opportunity to repent.
Where is our love?
What is love?

> **This is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.** [(1Jn 4:10‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+4/)

Sacrificial love---if we believe it, then we show it.

> **"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."**

AMEN.
