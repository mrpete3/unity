## Old Testament [Is 14:12‑17]

> [12] “How you are fallen from heaven,\
> O Day Star, son of Dawn!\
> How you are cut down to the ground,\
> you who laid the nations low!\
> [13] You said in your heart,\
> ‘I will ascend to heaven;\
> above the stars of God\
> I will set my throne on high;\
> I will sit on the mount of assembly\
> in the far reaches of the north;\
> [14] I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;\
> I will make myself like the Most High.’\
> [15] But you are brought down to Sheol,\
> to the far reaches of the pit.\
> [16] Those who see you will stare at you\
> and ponder over you:\
> ‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,\
> who shook kingdoms,\
> [17] who made the world like a desert\
> and overthrew its cities,\
> who did not let his prisoners go home?’

## Epistle lesson [Rv 2:8‑11 ESV; sermon text]

[8] "And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‘The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life. 
[9] I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 
[10] Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. 
[11] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.’"

## Holy Gospel [Mt 24:5‑14]

[5] "For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 
[6] And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. 
[7] For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 
[8] All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. 

[9] "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. 
[10] And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. 
[11] And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 
[12] And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. 
[13] But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 
[14] And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of Him. Even so. Amen. "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty"** [(Rv 1:4‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Tonight we have come to the message to the church in Smyrna.

It happens to be that it is through Smyrna that we come into contact with a very early record concerning the persecution of the Christian Church.
There was a bishop of Smyrna, known in church history as Polycarp of Smyrna, who is believed to have personally know the apostle John---the apostle who received and wrote down the book of Revelation.
If you have ever heard of the early church father Irenaeus, Irenaeus was a disciple of Polycarp and Polycarp was likely a disciple of the apostle John himself.
In the message to the church in Smyrna, of which Polycarp was soon to be bishop, there is the pronouncement of future suffering for the name of Jesus:

> **Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.** 

The first recorded Christian martyrdom is that of the deacon Stephen in Acts, chapter 7.
The second recorded Christian martyrdom is not in the Bible, but and [extrabiblical document](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/richardson/fathers.vii.i.iii.html) describing the martyrdom of Polycarp of Smyrna.[^1]

AMEN.

## Notes

Is 14:12. Though this verse speaks directly to the fall of Babylon, Jesus may allude to this verse in [Lk 10:18](https://www.esv.org/Luke+10/) and [Rv 12:8‑9](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+12/) in describing Satan's fall from heaven.

Smyrna is modern-day Izmir and about forty miles north of Ephesus.

Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, was born about A.D. 69 and may have known the apotle John, whose writing he quotes.
A defender of orthodoxy, Polycarp was martyred about A.D. 155 for refusing to deny his faith in Christ.
