## Old Testament [1Ki 16:29‑33]

[29] In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. 
[30] And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord, more than all who were before him. 
[31] And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him. 
[32] He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. 
[33] And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.

## Epistle lesson [Rv 2:12‑29 ESV; sermon text]

[12] “And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‘The words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword. 

[13] “‘I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. 
[14] But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality. 
[15] So also you have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
[16] Therefore repent. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth. 
[17] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.’ 

[18] “And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: ‘The words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze. 

[19] "‘I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first. 
[20] But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
[21] I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality. 
[22] Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, 
[23] and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works. 
[24] But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay on you any other burden. 
[25] Only hold fast what you have until I come. 
[26] The one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, 
[27] and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received authority from my Father. 
[28] And I will give him the morning star. 
[29] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’"

## Holy Gospel [Mt 25:31‑46]

[31] “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 
[32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 
[33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. 
[34] Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 
[35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 
[36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ 
[37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 
[38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 
[39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ 
[40] And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ 

[41] “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 
[42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 
[43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ 
[44] Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ 
[45] Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ 
[46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

## Introit [Psalm 7:8, 9-10,17]

> Let the Lord judge the peoples.*\
> O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure.\
> My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.*\
> I will give thanks to the Lord because of His righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.|

## Collect
> Jesus, Son of God, You know my faith, my love, my service, what I have done, and what I have not done. Grant me discernment of good and evil so nothing false might deceive me and lead me away from true righteousness, which is Your gift to me. In Your name I pray. Amen.

O Jesus, risen Savior,

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of Him. Even so. Amen. "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty"** [(Rv 1:4‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Beloved in the Lord, tonight we hear the messages to the churches in Pergamum and Thyatira.
Let us begin with an English lesson about the origin of the word *parchment*.
*Parchment*'s Latin etymology is *pergamīnum*---ah, sounds like *Pergamum*, which is where parchment was invented.
You may have learned about how the invention of the printing press changed our world, but so did the invention of parchment.
Parchment was an improvement over papyrus paper.
Parchment is durable and is made of sheep skin; papyrus is made out of the papyrus reed and falls apart more quickly over time.
Ancient history was transformed by the invention of parchment and it happened, of all places, at Pergamum, the home of one of the churches to which Christ now writes a letter.

> **"And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: 'The words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.'"**

If you have not yet picture it, picture it now: a sword coming out of the mouth of Christ [(Rv 1:16)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).
And remember what is written about God's Word in Hebrews, chapter 4:

> **For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.** [(Heb 4:12‑13 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+4/)

The Bible teaches us that Christ's Word is a two-edged sword.
Christ's Word is a surgical scalpel that can separate soul from spirit, joints from marrow---God's Word, by the power of the Holy Spirit, reveals the thoughts and intentions of your heart.
Christ knows the thoughts and intentions of your heart, and it is by the thoughts and intentions of your heart that you will be judged.

Take the church at Pergamum:

> **I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."**

*Satan's throne* may refert to Pergamum's prominence as the chief center for the worship of Roman gods---Pergamum is a pagan city.

> **But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality.**
 
Who are the Nicolatians? According to an early commentary on the book of Revelation, the Nicolatians advocated eating meat sacrificed to idols and promised peace to fornicators on the eighth day after the offense.
We really do not have any more details, but being a follower of the Nicolatians may have involved participating in a pagan ritual where sacrificed meat is eaten as having been sacrificed to an idol, followed by sexual immorality which was acknowledged as a sin but then forgiven only to be repeated.
Whatever their practice was, Jesus hates it.

What is troubling is that the church in Pergamum had been faithful under persecution.
They had good works that help them none when tempted by sexual immorality.
We will now see that this is also the case for Thyatira:

> **"I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first."** 

> **But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.** 

This, of course, calls to mind one of the worst passages in the Old Testament:

> **And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, [Ahab] took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him. He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.**

If you are tired of sexual immorality by now, so is Jesus!
However, we tolerate sexual immorality in our city's culture.
Even professing Christians tolerate it.
Christ warns, **"Repent. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth."**

But after repenting of sexual immorality, what is there?
Christ! Who is Christ and who is His Church?
Repent of sexual immorality as a sin against God.
Repent of sexual immorality as a sin against marriage, for God made human sexuality for one reason and one reason only---that husband and wife be one flesh.
That we may know what marriage is, He made us the Bride of Christ and Christ our Bridegroom.

Christ our Bridegroom is utterly faithful---He is concerned for us and us alone.
Last Sunday, we heard Christ tell us what was on His mind---His Cross and His Resurrection.

Christ our Bridegroom is utterly sacrificial.
This is His love---sacrifice.

> **"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."**

AMEN.
