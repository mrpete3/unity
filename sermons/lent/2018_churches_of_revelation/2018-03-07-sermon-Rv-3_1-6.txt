## Old Testament [Is 29:13‑16]

> [13] And the Lord said:\
> “Because this people draw near with their mouth\
> and honor me with their lips,\
> while their hearts are far from me,\
> and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,\
> [14] therefore, behold, I will again\
> do wonderful things with this people,\
> with wonder upon wonder;\
> and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,\
> and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden.”

> [15] Ah, you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel,\
> whose deeds are in the dark,\
> and who say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”\
> [16] You turn things upside down!\
> Shall the potter be regarded as the clay,\
> that the thing made should say of its maker,\
> “He did not make me”;\
> or the thing formed say of him who formed it,\
> “He has no understanding”?

## Epistle lesson [Rv 3:1‑6 ESV; sermon text]

[1] “And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: ‘The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.

"‘I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. [2] Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. [3] Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you. [4] Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy. [5] The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. [6] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’"

## Holy Gospel [Mt 24:42‑51]

[42] "Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 
[43] But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 
[44] Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. 

[45] "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? 
[46] Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. 
[47] Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. 
[48] But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’ 
[49] and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, 
[50] the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know 
[51] and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

## Introit [Psalm 139:1-4, 11-12, 23-24][^1]

[^1]: This psalm is not ESV.

> O LORD, You have searched me and You know me.\
> You know when I sit and when I rise; You perceive my thoughts from afar.\
> You discern my going out and my lying down; You are familiar with all my ways.\
> Before a word is on my tongue You know it completely, O LORD.\
> If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,"\
> Even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.\
> Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.\
> See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.\

## Collect

> Lord Jesus, coming Judge, keep me ever watchful that I might not stain my garments with sin. Through Your Word and Spirit, perfect (use as verb!) holiness in my life that the Last Day may find me prepared through repentance and faith. In Your name I pray. Amen.


## Hymns

* Hymn: _TLH_ 609 _Wake, Awake for Night is Flying_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **"grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."** [(Rv 1:4‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Beloved in the Lord, tonight we hear Christ's letter to the Church in Sardis,
and this one does not start off well.

> **"‘I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead."**

In these last days of deceit and trouble, beware of having a reputation of being alive---beware.
The Church in Sardis has a reputation for being alive, but is dead---their faith is, in fact, *dying* contrary to others lifting them us saying, "These are real Christians."
God forbid that we should be like the dying church at Sardis.
Beware of the deception of making an appearance that we are alive when we are dead,
and let us not automatically receive someone else's praise and think that God approves of what we are doing.

I believe the point for us today is simple: it is not necessarily an honor when others complement us.
Beware of who speaks highly of us.
Do pagans speak highly of us?
Do we fit in with them and make them feel accepted *in* their materialism?
Do we fit in with pagans and make them feel accepted *in* their sexual immorality?
For example, if I, pastor of Unity Lutheran Church, welcomed cohabitating couples with open arms and said, "Sure, you can be married here before God, no questions asked," many people, I believe, would speak highly of me.
It is quite possible our membership would increase if I looked the other way on fornication.
But the time has come---now, before the return of our Lord---to stop caving in to pagan beliefs and practices.
This appears to be our Lord's message to the church at Sardis.

In the case of the Christians at Sardis, maybe they saw little difference between Christ and the pagan gods.
As a matter of fact, the Ides of March, March 15, started a pagan "holy week" around Sardis honoring the false gods Cybele and her son Attis.
(This "holy week" lasted for more like two weeks.)
As and infant, it is believed that Attis is exposed in the reeds along a riverbank, much like Moses.
Cybele rescues Attis from the reeds.
During the festival, Attis's death under a pine tree is commemorated by cutting down a tree and suspending an image of Attis on it.[^2]
It is not hard to draw a parallel to our Lord Jesus suspended from the Cross.
Maybe to people in Sardis the goddess Cybele, the mother goddess, was like Mary, the mother of God.
The resurrection of Attis is celebrated in the spring; so is the Resurrection of Jesus.
You know the argument.
One person follows this god, another that god, but each path has the same goal: eternal life with the god of one's choosing.[^3]

If that was not the case in Sardis, it is certainly the case today.
It may even be a majority opinion among Americans that what god you worship does not matter---each one is just a manifestation of the one true God and you will get to heaven.
Though we may be tempted to let it go, remember what the Law and the Prophets reveal.
God promised the land of Canaan to the Israelites because He was intent on destroying the pagans---man, woman, and child---who lived there.
What they believed and practiced, including trusting their gods to help them when the performed rituals of burning incense and burning their children, the Bible says was *abominable* to the true God.
Consider carefully what God has revealed in the Bible and do not---under any circumstances, make an appearance that you can live with what God finds abominable.

> **If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.**

Wake up and repent of abetting pagan beliefs and practices!
If we do not, we will find that Christ, on the day of His return, will be *against* us, not for us.

> **Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.**

> **The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.**

> **"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."**

AMEN.
