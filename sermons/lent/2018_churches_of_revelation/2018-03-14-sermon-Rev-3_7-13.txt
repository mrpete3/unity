## Old Testament [Is 60:3‑11 ESV]

> [3] And nations shall come to your light,\
> and kings to the brightness of your rising.

> [4] Lift up your eyes all around, and see;\
> they all gather together, they come to you;\
> your sons shall come from afar,\
> and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.\
> [5] Then you shall see and be radiant;\
> your heart shall thrill and exult,\
> because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,\
> the wealth of the nations shall come to you.\
> [6] A multitude of camels shall cover you,\
> the young camels of Midian and Ephah;\
> all those from Sheba shall come.\
> They shall bring gold and frankincense,\
> and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.\
> [7] All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you;\
> the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you;\
> they shall come up with acceptance on my altar,\
> and I will beautify my beautiful house.

> [8] Who are these that fly like a cloud,\
> and like doves to their windows?\
> [9] For the coastlands shall hope for me,\
> the ships of Tarshish first,\
> to bring your children from afar,\
> their silver and gold with them,\
> for the name of the LORD your God,\
> and for the Holy One of Israel,\
> because he has made you beautiful.

> [10] Foreigners shall build up your walls,\
> and their kings shall minister to you;\
> for in my wrath I struck you,\
> but in my favor I have had mercy on you.\
> [11] Your gates shall be open continually;\
> day and night they shall not be shut,\
> that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations,\
> with their kings led in procession.\
> [12] For the nation and kingdom\
> that will not serve you shall perish;\
> those nations shall be utterly laid waste.\
> [13] The glory of Lebanon shall come to you,\
> the cypress, the plane, and the pine,\
> to beautify the place of my sanctuary,\
> and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

## Epistle lesson [Rv 3:7‑13 ESV; sermon text]

[7]  “And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‘The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens. 

[8]  “‘I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. 
[9]  Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that I have loved you. 
[10]  Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth. 
[11]  I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown. 
[12]  The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. 
[13]  He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”

## Holy Gospel [Mt 28:16‑20 ESV]

[16]  Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. 
[17]  And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. 
[18]  And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
[19]  Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in[a] the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
[20]  teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

## Introit [Psalm 132:11, 13-18][^1]

[^1]: This psalm is not ESV.

> The LORD swore an oath to David a sure oath that He will not revoke:\
> "One of your own descendants I will place on your throne."\
> For the LORD has chosen Zion, He has desired it for His dwelling:\
> "This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it --\
> I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor will I satisfy with food.\
> I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will ever sing for joy.\
> Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for My Anointed One.
> I will clothe His enemies with shame, but the crown on His head will be resplendent.".\

## Collect

> Jesus, Son of David, Son of God, King of Your church, help me not only to endure suffering in faith but also to use the door You have opened to invite others to trust You. Give to me and all believers the crown of life that You have won for us. In Your saving name I pray. Amen.

* Hymn: _TLH_ 516 _In the Hour of Trial_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **"grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."** [(Rv 1:4‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Beloved in the Lord, tonight we hear Christ's letter to the Church in Philadelphia,
the original city of brotherly love.

> **"The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens."**

AMEN.
