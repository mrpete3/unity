> I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will ever sing for joy.\

## Hymns

* Hymn: _TLH_ 516 _In the Hour of Trial_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **"grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."** [(Rv 1:4‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Beloved in the Lord, tonight we hear Christ's letter to the Church in Sardis,
and this one does not start off well.

> **"‘I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead."**
 

> **Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.**

> **The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.**

> **"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."**

AMEN.
