## Old Testament [Is 60:3‑11 ESV]

> [3] And nations shall come to your light,\
> and kings to the brightness of your rising.

> [4] Lift up your eyes all around, and see;\
> they all gather together, they come to you;\
> your sons shall come from afar,\
> and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.\
> [5] Then you shall see and be radiant;\
> your heart shall thrill and exult,\
> because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,\
> the wealth of the nations shall come to you.\
> [6] A multitude of camels shall cover you,\
> the young camels of Midian and Ephah;\
> all those from Sheba shall come.\
> They shall bring gold and frankincense,\
> and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.\
> [7] All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you;\
> the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you;\
> they shall come up with acceptance on my altar,\
> and I will beautify my beautiful house.

> [8] Who are these that fly like a cloud,\
> and like doves to their windows?\
> [9] For the coastlands shall hope for me,\
> the ships of Tarshish first,\
> to bring your children from afar,\
> their silver and gold with them,\
> for the name of the LORD your God,\
> and for the Holy One of Israel,\
> because he has made you beautiful.

> [10] Foreigners shall build up your walls,\
> and their kings shall minister to you;\
> for in my wrath I struck you,\
> but in my favor I have had mercy on you.\
> [11] Your gates shall be open continually;\
> day and night they shall not be shut,\
> that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations,\
> with their kings led in procession.\
> [12] For the nation and kingdom\
> that will not serve you shall perish;\
> those nations shall be utterly laid waste.\
> [13] The glory of Lebanon shall come to you,\
> the cypress, the plane, and the pine,\
> to beautify the place of my sanctuary,\
> and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

## Epistle lesson [Rv 3:7‑13 ESV; sermon text]

[7]  “And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‘The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens. 

[8]  “‘I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. 
[9]  Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that I have loved you. 
[10]  Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth. 
[11]  I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown. 
[12]  The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. 
[13]  He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”

## Holy Gospel [Mt 28:16‑20 ESV]

[16]  Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. 
[17]  And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. 
[18]  And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
[19]  Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in[a] the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
[20]  teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

## Introit [Psalm 132:11, 13-18][^1]

[^1]: This psalm is not ESV.

> The LORD swore an oath to David a sure oath that He will not revoke:\
> "One of your own descendants I will place on your throne."\
> For the LORD has chosen Zion, He has desired it for His dwelling:\
> "This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it --\
> I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor will I satisfy with food.\
> I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will ever sing for joy.\
> Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for My Anointed One.
> I will clothe His enemies with shame, but the crown on His head will be resplendent.".\

## Collect

> Jesus, Son of David, Son of God, King of Your church, help me not only to endure suffering in faith but also to use the door You have opened to invite others to trust You. Give to me and all believers the crown of life that You have won for us. In Your saving name I pray. Amen.


## Hymns

* Hymn: _TLH_ 516 _In the Hour of Trial_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **"grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has _freed us from our sins by His blood_ and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."** [(Rv 1:4‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Beloved in the Lord, tonight we hear Christ's letter to the Church in Philadelphia,
the original city of brotherly love.

> **"The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens."**

Christ has the key of David---the key of the line of David---the key of the promised Messiah---the key of the King of the Jews---the key with which He unlocks the door, and that is it: the door is open.
It is also the key with which He locks the door, and that is it: the door is locked.
And that is the door to the kingdom of heaven.
Interesting that right at the beginning of His letter to the church in Philadelphia, our Lord should bring up what we learned in the catechism:

> *What is the Office of the **Keys**?* The Office of the Keys is that special authority which Christ has *given to His Church* on earth to forgive the sins of repentant sinners, but to withhold forgiveness from the unrepentant as long as they do not repent.

Jesus tells the church in Philadelphia, "I *have* that key---I have the key that opens and closes heaven."
The Office of the Keys is that our Lord has delegated to us---His Church, of all people---He has delegated to us the use of that key.

> *Where is this written?* This is what St. John the Evangelist writes in chapter twenty: **The Lord Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."** (Jn 20:22‑23 NIV84)

We are Christ's Church, and we have His Word, and by His Word we know what sin is.
It is our job, in these last days, to point out sin according to Christ's Word and say, "This is serious! Repent."
Our job is to point out sin in a non-judgmental way, since we confess that we are *not* the Great Judge, but *we know who the Judge is*; He is Jesus, who comes to judge the living and the dead.
Here we are, reading this letter He wrote for us to hear before He comes as the Great Judge on the Last Day, and we know the Word by which He will judge: God's holy Ten Commandments.
We are doing everyone a favor by pointing out a sin according to Christ's Word and saying, "This is serious! Repent."

*[Illustration]* If, for example, God forbid, a member of our church were an embezzler and one of us found out, the one who found out would approach the embezzler privately, according to Matthew 18, and point out his sin.
This is not judgmental---it is simply doing what our Lord commands us to do.
If he commands it, then His authority backs it up.
The embezzler needs to hear the Seventh Commandment:

> **You shall not steal.** *What does this mean?* We should fear and love God so that we do not take our neighbor's money or possessions, or get them in any dishonest way, but help him to improve and protect his possessions and income.

If the embezzler does not listen, bring in the pastor and the elders and make it an official church issue.
If the embezzler remains unrepentant---"I did nothing wrong"---treat him as a Pharisee and a tax collector---no longer a Christian.
His sins are retained, not only on earth but also in heaven according to the Office of the Keys because *this is Christ's Word*---his sins are retained and counted against him because he refuses to repent of what God, in His Word, clearly declares to be a sin.

That is the key that closes heaven, but what about the key that *opens* heaven?
You hear the key open the door every Sunday:

> *Upon this your confession, I, by virtue of my office, as a called and ordained servant of the Word, announce the grace of God unto all of you, and **in the stead and by the command** of my Lord Jesus Christ I forgive you all your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.*

That is the sound of Christ's key opening the door of heaven to every sinner who repents.
Beloved in the Lord, the hardest thing to do as a Christian is to believe that the Office of the Keys is true: When your pastor or any Christian, upon your confession, declares you forgiven in the stead and by the command of Jesus Christ, what you have heard on earth is a reality in heaven.

If you ever would go to private confession, you would hear from your pastor, "Do you believe that my forgiveness is God's forgiveness?"
This is a serious question.
Jesus did say, **"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, _they are forgiven_."**
Believe the Word of Absolution in Christ's name and hear it: the key turning, and the door to heaven opening.
*[Pray]* (Gracious Father, grant that we, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, believe Your Absolution spoken by the mouth of Your Church, through Jesus Christ, Your Son, in whose name forgiveness is ours, Amen.)

To the church in Philadelphia, our Lord has not condemnation, for they have not denied His name. There is only promise.

> **"I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name."** 

We may be of little power, and we may get weaker still, but let us not deny Jesus, in whose name we are richly and daily absolved of our sins.
AMEN.
