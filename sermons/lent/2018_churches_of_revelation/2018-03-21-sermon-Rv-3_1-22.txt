## Old Testament [Amos 6:1‑7 ESV]

## Epistle lesson [Rv 3:14‑22 ESV; sermon text]

[14] “And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: ‘The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation.

[15] “‘I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! 
[16] So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. 
[17] For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. 
[18] I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. 
[19] Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent. 
[20] Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. 
[21] The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. 
[22] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”

> Dear Lord Jesus, the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of creation, ignite in my heart the fire of Your love that I might flee from all things hurtful and run to You. Cover my sin and shame and heal my eyes so I may see Your love for me. In Your name I pray. Amen.


## Hymns

* Hymn: _TLH_ 409 _Let Us Ever Walk With Jesus_

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, **"grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To Him who loves us and has _freed us from our sins by His blood_ and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."** [(Rv 1:4‑6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/).

> **I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."** [(Rv 1:9‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1/)

Beloved in the Lord, tonight we hear Christ's letter to the Church in Laodicea.
*Laodicea*---*lukewarm*.

> **"I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth."** 

And if you remember by these words the words of Elijah the prophet on Mount Carmel, well done!

> **And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word.** [(1Ki 18:21 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings+18:21&version=ESV)

We cannot sit on the fence with God and and idol.
**"How long will you go limping between two different opinions?"**
Are we hot or are we cold?
If we are not sure, the Lord will spit us out of His mouth.
It is important here to say *we*, and not so much *you* personally because this is a letter to a *church*---a *congregation* like Unity Lutheran Church---not a letter to an individual.

We cannot sit on the fence looking God on one side and and idol on the other side.
We must get off the fence and jump onto the side of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, never looking back at our idol, whatever it may be.
But what is perhaps the biggest American idol? *Money.*
What are the Christians like in Laodicea? They think they are rich.

> **"For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked."**

If the Lord has blessed us materially and we have prospered economically and have our financial house in order, beware!
We may believe we need nothing when in fact, **we are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.**

Did not our Lord give teach us the Parable of the Rich Fool?

> **Someone in the crowd said to [Jesus], “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”** [(Lk 12:13‑21 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12&version=ESV)

If we ever forget what to think about our money, let us not forget St. Paul's warning in 1 Timothy 6:10 not to love our money:

> **For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.**

If we ever forget what to do with our money, let us not forget our Lord's promise in tithing, writtn in Malachi, chapter 3:

> **Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.** [(Mal 3:8‑10 ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3&version=ESV)

And finally, again, from St. Paul in Ephesians 4:28:

> **Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.**

For our Lord Jesus comes to us in our need---when we had a debt that money could not pay, He shed His holy, precious, blood to ransom us from the devil. Let us gladly then share our money with those in need.
AMEN.
