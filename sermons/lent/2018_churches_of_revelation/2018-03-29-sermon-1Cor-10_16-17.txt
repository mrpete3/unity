## Old Testament [Ex 24:3‑11 ESV]

[3] Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and all the rules. And all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the words that the LORD has spoken we will do.”
[4] And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
[5] And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.
[6] And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar.
[7] Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”
[8] And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”

[9] Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, [10] and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. [11] And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.

## Epistle [1Co 10:16‑17 ESV]

[16] The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? [17] Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.

------------

[16] τὸ ποτήριον τῆς εὐλογίας ὃ εὐλογοῦμεν, οὐχὶ κοινωνία ἐστὶν τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ; τὸν ἄρτον ὃν κλῶμεν, οὐχὶ κοινωνία τοῦ σώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐστιν; [17] ὅτι εἷς ἄρτος, ἓν σῶμα οἱ πολλοί ἐσμεν, οἱ γὰρ πάντες ἐκ τοῦ ἑνὸς ἄρτου μετέχομεν. 

## Holy Gospel [Mk 14:12‑26 ESV; sermon text]

[12] And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?” [13] And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, [14] and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ [15] And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.” [16] And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

[17] And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. [18] And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.” [19] They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?” [20] He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. [21] For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”

[22] And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.”
[23] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.
[24] And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
[25] Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
[26] And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
In the Old Testament reading we have again Moses with the Israelites in the wilderness on the way to the Promised Land.
You know; you have heard it before.
The LORD has brought them out of Egyptian slavery and is taking them to the Promised Land.
Time and time again, it is back to Moses and the Israelites in the wilderness---Moses wrote this down for us---for Christ's Church---so that we would know that we, too, were once slaves ... to Satan.

> **And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.** [(Eph 2:1‑2 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2/)

The **prince of the power of the air** is the devil, and St. Paul himself says this about each of us---that we were *dead* in sin while we followed the devil.
Not very flattering to be called dead in sin, but it is true.
It is true and the Holy Spirit was careful to have St. Paul write this for us to hear: we were dead in our trespasses in sins when we served the devil.

Our Old Testament reading is from Exodus, chapter 24, and hear what the Israelites promised God after Moses had written down God's Commandments and read them to the congregation:

> **Then [Moses] took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that the LORD has spoken _we will do_, and _we will be obedient_.”** [(Ex 24:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+24/)

"We'll do it! We'll keep the Ten Commandments and not stray from them."
That was the promise they made in Exodus, chapter 24, ... and by Exodus, chapter 32, what did the Israelites do? Worship the golden calf!
So much for their promise to live by the First Commandment: **You shall have no other gods!**
They failed miserably!
Funny, but it is not.
The Israelites were a colossal failure for keeping the Commandments.
Though they said, *in sincerity*, that they would be obedient---that they would be good---what really happened?
What really happened is that they listened to the devil anyway.
For this, God intended to kill all of them---not funny at all---but Moses changed God's mind by bringing up the Egyptians:
**"Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did [their God] bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people"** [(Ex 32:12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+32/).
Had Moses not pleaded for the Israelites, God would have killed them all and started a new nation through Moses (Ex 32:10).

The point is, what good is a sincere desire to keep God's Commandments?
No good at all---I mean, it does not work.
It is good to *want* to keep them, but the Commandments by themselves, even combined with our good intentions, *have no power* to keep even one of us from serving the devil.
Our flesh is simply too powerful and infected by sin.
Too bad, but it is true: it is in the Bible.

> **All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;**\
> **no one does good, not even one.** [(Rm 3:12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3/)

That is the covenant of the Commandments: keep the Commandments and God will bless you.
God is faithful on His side, but we are unfaithful on our side.
Learn well the lesson of the golden calf!

Today, however, is Maundy Thursday---a big day for those who are frustrated by not having kept the Commandments.
Today is Maundy Thursday and we have in the Holy Gospel Christ's words recorded by which He institutes the Lord's Supper.
We have Christ's words recorded in the Gospel of mark, and Mark's Gospel is concise:

> **As they were eating, [Jesus] took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, "Take; this is my body." And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, "_This is my blood of the covenant_, which is poured out for many."** [(Mk 14:22‑24 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+14/)

In Luke's Gospel, Christ says, **"New covenant"** [(Lk 22:20)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22/).
We have *given to us* tonight the *new covenant* in Jesus' blood.
The old covenant is valid, but saves *no one*.
The old covenant of the Ten Commandments was given to us with strings attached.
"*If* you keep these, I will bless you."
The new covenant is simply *given to us*: "Here, have it. This cup is the new covenant in My blood, given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins" [(Mt 26:28)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+26/).
Believe it and you have it! No strings attached; no Commandment for you to keep: you are *given* forgiveness for free.
The prophet Jeremiah, called it:

> **“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a *new covenant* with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they *broke*, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: ... They shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For _I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more._”** [(Jer 31:31‑34 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31/)

When you come to the altar and receive Christ body and blood on your lips, you are by faith receiving *total disappearance of your sins from God's memory*.
Yes, Jesus will die on the Cross tomorrow.
He body will be put to death; His blood will be shed in your place to pay for your sins.
Here, He *physically* delivers His same body and blood to you and says, "Here, I am yours."
He does this not symbolically, but *really*.

> **The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?** [(1Co 10:16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10/)

Come, receive Christ's true body and blood, given and shed for your for the forgiveness of sins.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4/).
AMEN.
