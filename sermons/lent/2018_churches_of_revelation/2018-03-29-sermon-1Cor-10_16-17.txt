> Gracious is the LORD, and | righteous;\*\
> our God is | merciful.\
> I love the LORD, because | he has heard\*\
> my voice and my pleas for | mercy.\
> Because he inclined his | ear to me,\*\

> "O LORD, I pray, deliv- | er my soul!"\
> Gracious is the LORD, and | righteous;\*\
> our God is | merciful.\
