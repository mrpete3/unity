## Old Testament [Is 46:1‑11 ESV]

> [1] Bel bows down; Nebo stoops;\
> their idols are on beasts and livestock;\
> these things you carry are borne\
> as burdens on weary beasts.\
> [2] They stoop; they bow down together;\
> they cannot save the burden,\
> but themselves go into captivity.


> [3] “Listen to me, O house of Jacob,\
> all the remnant of the house of Israel,\
> who have been borne by me from before your birth,\
> carried from the womb;\
> [4] even to your old age I am he,\
> and to gray hairs I will carry you.\
> I have made, and I will bear;\
> I will carry and will save.


> [5] “To whom will you liken me and make me equal,\
> and compare me, that we may be alike?\
> [6] Those who lavish gold from the purse,\
> and weigh out silver in the scales,\
> hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god;\
> then they fall down and worship!\
> [7] They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it,\
> they set it in its place, and it stands there;\
> it cannot move from its place.\
> If one cries to it, it does not answer\
> or save him from his trouble.


> [8] “Remember this and stand firm,\
> recall it to mind, you transgressors,\
> [9] 	remember the former things of old;\
> for I am God, and there is no other;\
> I am God, and there is none like me,\
> [10] declaring the end from the beginning\
> and from ancient times things not yet done,\
> saying, ‘My counsel shall stand,\
> and I will accomplish all my purpose,’\
> [11] calling a bird of prey from the east,\
> the man of my counsel from a far country.\
> I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass;\
> I have purposed, and I will do it.


## Epistle [Rm 8:31‑39 ESV]

[31] What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? [32] He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? [33] Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. [34] Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. [35] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? [36] As it is written,

> “For your sake we are being killed all the day long;\
> we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”
	
[37] No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. [38] For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, [39] nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 16:25‑33 ESV; sermon text]

[25] “I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father. [26] In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf; [27] for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. [28] I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father.”

[29] His disciples said, “Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech! [30] Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that you came from God.” [31] Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? [32] Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. [33] I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

[25] Ταῦτα ἐν παροιμίαις λελάληκα ὑμῖν: ἔρχεται ὥρα ὅτε οὐκέτι ἐν παροιμίαις λαλήσω ὑμῖν ἀλλὰ παρρησίᾳ περὶ τοῦ πατρὸς ἀπαγγελῶ ὑμῖν. 
[26] ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου αἰτήσεσθε, καὶ οὐ λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐρωτήσω τὸν πατέρα περὶ ὑμῶν: 
[27] αὐτὸς γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ φιλεῖ ὑμᾶς, ὅτι ὑμεῖς ἐμὲ πεφιλήκατε καὶ πεπιστεύκατε ὅτι ἐγὼ παρὰ [τοῦ] θεοῦ ἐξῆλθον. 
[28] ἐξῆλθον παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ ἐλήλυθα εἰς τὸν κόσμον: πάλιν ἀφίημι τὸν κόσμον καὶ πορεύομαι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα. 

[29] Λέγουσιν οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ, Ἴδε νῦν ἐν παρρησίᾳ λαλεῖς, καὶ παροιμίαν οὐδεμίαν λέγεις. 
[30] νῦν οἴδαμεν ὅτι οἶδας πάντα καὶ οὐ χρείαν ἔχεις ἵνα τίς σε ἐρωτᾷ: ἐν τούτῳ πιστεύομεν ὅτι ἀπὸ θεοῦ ἐξῆλθες. 
[31] ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς Ἰησοῦς, Ἄρτι πιστεύετε; 
[32] ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται ὥρα καὶ ἐλήλυθεν ἵνα σκορπισθῆτε ἕκαστος εἰς τὰ ἴδια κἀμὲ μόνον ἀφῆτε: καὶ οὐκ εἰμὶ μόνος, ὅτι ὁ πατὴρ μετ' ἐμοῦ ἐστιν. 
[33] ταῦτα λελάληκα ὑμῖν ἵνα ἐν ἐμοὶ εἰρήνην ἔχητε: ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ θλῖψιν ἔχετε, ἀλλὰ θαρσεῖτε, ἐγὼ νενίκηκα τὸν κόσμον.

## Collect

Almighty God, merciful Father, who made the light to shine out of the darkness, we thank You that You have shown mercy to us and our fathers, and by means of Your servant Martin Luther have restored the pure light of Your Gospel. Keep us, we ask You, in sound doctrine, that we may steadfastly believe and worthily follow Your saving Word, and finally, by its holy comfort, depart in peace and joy; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
You heard in our Old Testament reading from the mouth of the LORD that **"My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose"** [(Is 46:10b ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+46/).
He will accomplish His purpose, but *how* will He accomplish His purpose?
Nine chapters later in the book of Isaiah He tells us *how* He will accomplish His purpose:

> **For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven**\
> **and do not return there but water the earth,**\
> **making it bring forth and sprout,**\
> **giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,**\
> **so shall _my word_ be that goes out from my mouth;**\
> **it shall not return to me empty,**\
> **but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,**\
> **and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.** [(Is 55:10‑11 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+55/)

God chooses to accomplish what He purposes any way He wants.
He could choose to accomplish what He purposes by altering the weather.
He could choose to accomplish what He purposes by sending superheroes to get the job done.
But what has He chosen to accomplish that which He purposes? He chooses *His Word*:

> **So shall *my word* be that goes out from my mouth;**\
> **it shall not return to me empty,**\
> **but *it shall accomplish* that which I purpose,**\
> **and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.**

From the beginning of creation---**"and God _said_, 'Let there be light'"** [(Gn 1:3)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1/)---even to this very day, what God wants to accomplish, He has chosen to achieve *by His Word*.
(It is a great encouragement even that we are here, gathered around God's Word, for we know that it is here that God chooses to act.)
He speaks His Word and it never returns empty; like the rain that does not return to the heavens but waters the earth and makes seed to sprout and feed us, so is His Word.
His Word has purpose and His Word always works.

Yet *the Word* takes a concrete meaning in the first chapter of St. John's Gospel:

> **In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. ... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.** [(Jn 1:1‑3, 14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+1/)

*The Word* is the Son of God---*the Word* is another name for Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit are one God now and forever.
**The Word became flesh and dwelt among us**---He was born of the virgin Mary and was cared for by his step-father Joseph. His birth was announced by the angels to the shepherds, and, yes, Christmas is just around the corner, and, yes, we will celebrate the birth of Christ, that **the Word became flesh and dwelt among us**.

Yet we have another birth to celebrate today: the birth of Martin Luther.
He was born November 10, 1483, 534 years ago.
And the Bible also foretold the birth of Martin Luther. Not

> **To us a child is born,**\
> **to us a son is given;**\
> **and the government shall be upon his shoulder,**\
> **and his name shall be called**\
> **Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,**\
> **Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.** [(Is 9:6 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+9/)

Not *that* Scripture, but *this* Scripture foretold the birth of Martin Luther:

> **Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.** [(Ps 51:5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+51/)

Yes, Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483. Yes, his parents were Hans and Margarethe Luther. And yes, Martin Luther was _born a sinner_, and so is everyone except our Lord Jesus alone.
In Bible discussions, this teaching that everyone is born a sinner is called *the doctrine of original sin*.

You are well-aware that Luther taught from the Bible that our sins are certainly forgiven by faith alone, but perhaps you are less aware what He taught from the Bible about original sin; it has to do with the doctrine of free will.
Luther taught, "You have no free will because you were born with original sin, and once you are born with sin, you are a slave of sin."[^2]
And to prove that, He needed only to point to Psalm 51:5---**"in sin did my mother conceive me"**---and to the teaching of our Lord Jesus in John, chapter 8:

[^2]: *LW* 31:40

> **"Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin."** [(Jn 8:34 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+8/)

Add to that what St. Paul teaches in 1 Corinthians, chapter 2:

> **The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is _not able_ to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.** [(1Co 2:14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+2/)

In other words, a man stuck in sin cannot even begin to understand what the Spirit of God has to say.
Luther argued from God's Word that the born sinner cannot even *begin* to believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of sins.

And it is at this point---and this is the main point---that we can thank God that Martin Luther was born.
It is sad to remember that another child was born infected with sin.
It is sad to remember how he struggled, and failed, against sin.
The only glad thing about Luther being born is that God revealed His Word to him---He put a Bible under Luther's nose and gave him the Spirit to begin to understand his own depravity ... and gave him the Spirit to begin to understand Christ's glory given to man by the forgiveness of sins in His name.

What God clearly reveals in his Word is that Christ---even His Crucifixion---is glorious, because *[Point to the Crucifixion window.]* there God is washing away the sinful filth of the world.
Luther felt this personally: "All my filth from conception is washed clean by the blood of Jesus and is as certain for me personally as He has baptized me. Believe it and I have it."
Luther had tortured himself trying to make good by his own efforts everything he had done wrong, and he only found comfort---he only found certainty---in the forgiveness of sins found in the Cross.
Luther did not discover it, for it had always been revealed in God's Word:

> **For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.** [(1Co 2:2 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+2/)

Luther did none other that simply brought to light what God had always revealed in His Word:

> **Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD:**\
> **though your sins are like scarlet,**\
> **they shall be as white as snow;**\
> **though they are red like crimson,**\
> **they shall become like wool.** [(Is 1:18 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+1/)

What is God's Word? He has revealed to us His Word in the Bible. By the mouths of the prophets, evangelists, and apostles, the Holy Spirit

What can we say about the birth of Martin Luther?
He was born November 10, 1483 and he was born a sinner.
Behold what God's Word reveals about the first children of Adam and Eve.

Martin Luther was born a sinner and died a beggar.[^1]
