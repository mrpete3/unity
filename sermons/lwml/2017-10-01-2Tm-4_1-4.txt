## Old Testament [1Ki 8:54‑61 ESV]

[54] Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and plea to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven. [55] And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, [56] “Blessed be the LORD who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by Moses his servant. [57] The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. May he not leave us or forsake us, [58] that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his rules, which he commanded our fathers. [59] Let these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, and may he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as each day requires, [60] that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no other. [61] Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the LORD our God, walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day.” 

## Epistle [2Tm 4:1‑4 ESV; sermon text]

[1] I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: [2] preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. [3] For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, [4] and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 10:26‑33 ESV]

[26] “So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. [27] What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. [28] And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. [29] Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. [30] But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. [31] Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. [32] So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, [33] but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.

## Introit [Ps 46]

> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\
> Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,\
> though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,\
> though its waters roar and foam,\
> though the mountains tremble at its swelling.\
> There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,\
> the holy habitation of the Most High.\
> God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;\
> God will help her when morning dawns.\
> The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;\
> he utters his voice, the earth melts.\
> The LORD of hosts is with us;\
> The God of Jacob is our fortress.\
> Come, behold the works of the LORD, \
> how he has brought desolations on the earth.\
> He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;\
> he breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the chariots with fire.\
> “Be still, and know that I am God.\
> I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!”\
> The LORD of hosts is with us;\
> the God of Jacob is our fortress.

## Sermon[^1]

[^1]: Adapted from sermon written by Reverend Dr. Lawrence R. Rast Jr.‒President of Concordia Theological Seminary, Fort Wayne, Indiana: “Be Ready to Confess Jesus”

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2017 is really a rather amazing year. First off, of course, it is the
500th anniversary of Luther’s posting of the 95 Theses. The whole world
is paying attention to Martin Luther this year. Hopefully, though---and Luther himself would surely agree---the whole world would is paying attention to the name and person of Jesus Christ alone as the source of our salvation apart from our works.
Nevertheless, it seems like 2017 is all
Luther all the time---24/7/365! It *is* a big deal.

But there is even more to 2017. This year marks the 75th anniversary
of the *Lutheran Women’s Missionary League*, our LWML, which has done so much to encourage and support the sharing of Christ’s gospel within our Lutheran Church---Missouri Synod and among partners and friends throughout the world. This *is* a big deal!
In the half millennium since the Reformation began and the 75 years since the LWML formally organized itself, confessing the faith has not gotten any easier.
In fact, it may be even more difficult for us to speak and to live as Christians today than it was 75 years ago. And who knows what the future might hold for us, our children, and our grandchildren?
Yet God is faithful and has promised that His Church will survive all
the challenges that the devil, the world, and our own sinful flesh can throw at us. 

Building on God’s Word, we know that this is our opportunity to be distinctly Lutheran---*call* us Lutheran, and we will be glad to show you from the Bible who Jesus is and how He works in our lives.
As confessing Lutherans in a rapidly changing world and in an increasingly hostile culture, we need to *Be Ready to
Confess the Gospel of Christ* to a world that desperately needs to hear it.

* We have sinned before God and deserve to go to hell. We are not proud of our sins, but we have confessed our guilt to God and turn to Him for mercy.

* Jesus is both God, begotten of the Father from all eternity, and also true man, born of the virgin Mary.

* Jesus suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
By His innocent suffering and death *I am redeemed* from my sin and from hell. God has had mercy on my in only one way: by the person and work of Jesus Christ.

* I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ my Lord, or come to Him, but the *Holy Spirit* has called me by the hearing of the Gospel.

* My Baptism is the day when Christ washed me of my sins and my Baptism marks my having the Holy Spirit.

* I meet Christ personally not only in prayer and when studying the Bible, *[Point to the altar.]* but especially at the altar, where He serves me with His true body and blood.

Believe it, live it, but also *proclaim* it.
To be proclaimers of the message of salvation is central to our identity as Christ’s people.

> **I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke,
and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.** [(2Tm 4:1‑2)](https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+4/)

When Saint Paul wrote these words to Timothy, he did so as one writing to a fellow pastor, a man specifically called to carrying out the office of the public ministry.
And he did so also knowing full well the challenges that faced preachers of the Gospel in that day.
But he did so also knowing that Timothy had come to the faith through the Holy Spirit working through the faithful teaching of his committed mother and grandmother. 

> **I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in
your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.** [(2Tm 1:5)](https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+1/).

The good news of the Gospel is given to each of us to share with those whom God places in our
sphere of influence *regardless of our station in life*.
Saul was the king but the shepherd boy David killed Goliath in the name of the living God.
Naomi was a needy widow, but she shared her faith in the living God with her pagan daughter-in-law Ruth, and Ruth became the great-grandmother of who else but that same David!
God loves---God *specializes* in finding his children of low estate and using especially *them* to manifest His love and power.
The point is that proclaiming the salvation won by Jesus is not just
"the pastor’s job."
Every single one of us is called to be ready to confess Christ as God opens the doors for us to do so.
You are called to be ready to confess---to speak and show forth what you believe to be true!

The need for sharing Christ is as pronounced today as it has ever been.
The world is dying but you are not!
While it is true that somewhere around 90 percent of Americans claim that they believe in "God," their understanding of the one, true God is often *less than biblical*.
I do not know how many times someone someone has told me that they know God and I wait for him to confess some truth from the Bible and it does not come or comes garbled with human opinion.
As Lutherans, we are the first to say, "Show me from the Bible---Scripture alone!"
We have a book from the Reformation---the Book of Concord---where in point after point---whether it has to do with allowing pastors to marry or how we are to protect someone else's reputation or who Jesus is and how He is truly present at Holy Communion, we *show them from the Bible* what we believe.
Our understanding of God is *from the Bible*.
Add to that the fact that upwards of 60 percent of Evangelical
Christians (a category that would include LCMS members)---even Evangelical Christians think there may be other ways to salvation outside of faith in Jesus, and the need to be ready to confess the message of salvation by *grace alone* through *faith alone* because of *Christ alone* based on *the Bible alone* is as pressing today as ever.
Add to that Paul’s realistic assessment of where people were at his time.

> **For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the
truth and wander off into myths.** (2Tm 4:3-4 ESV)

That sounds like a commentary on 2017!

But not just 2017---also *15*17. The setting in which God called Martin Luther to confess Christ was easily as confused as our own day.
Worship of saints had intruded on worship of Christ; works were
preached as necessary to salvation *in addition to* faith in Christ; purgatory, images, relics, and other aberrations had obscured the Gospel of salvation in Christ alone.
This context, of course, led to the unique character of the Lutheran Reformation.
For Luther, as he read the New Testament and particularly read Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, was confronted by the question of righteousness: *What does it mean to be right in God’s eyes?* And the Scriptures were clear to him: *keep God’s law perfectly*.
However, he knew that he did not keep God’s law perfectly; he knew that
he did not keep God’s law sufficiently.
Oh, he tried to make things right.
He went to his priest repeatedly and confessed his sins.
He dredged up every thought, word, deed from a lifetime of sin, confessed it, was *conditionally* absolved (that is how it worked in the Roman Catholic Church)---conditionally absolved---and then went and did good works as a satisfaction.
But as he worked, he---uh oh!---remembered other sins.
His mind recalled other things that he had done, and he realized that his confession of sin was insufficient.
And that meant his works were not enough.
Finally, his priest confronted him: "Luther, it is not that
God hates you; it is that you hate God."
The dam finally broke when Luther understood, through the Scriptures, that the righteousness of God is *not about us being good enough.
The righteousness of God is about Christ who is perfect.*
Christ, the God-man, who has completed salvation for Luther, for you, and for me, perfectly, once and for all.

There is a great exchange that occurs. The filthy rags of our sinfulness and rebellion towards God, Jesus took upon Himself, *[Point to Crucifixion window.]* carried it to the Cross, and crucified it once and for all. The perfect righteousness
that is His, He now clothes us in and through the waters of Holy Baptism. Where before there was
sinner, God now sees his perfectly redeemed child through Christ; where before the person was far from God, there is now a child of God.
God’s work is for us and is applied to us freely and completely because
of Christ.

This---the biblical Gospel---is what we must be ready to confess!
Luther didn’t see all of this clearly in 1517.
It took a few years for him to work out all of the scriptural
implications.
But once he did he was ready to confess---and he did so to the end of his life in 1546.
Which poses a question for us: How do *we*, like Luther, prepare ourselves to be ready to confess?
Today in particular, as we've already noted, we want to recall the work of the Lutheran Women’s Missionary League, which is celebrating its diamond anniversary this year.
The LWML has had a marvelous impact on the mission efforts of the congregations, districts, seminaries, and other entities of our Synod. And it has done so always by carrying out faithfully its
mission "to assist each woman of The Lutheran Church---Missouri Synod in affirming her relationship with the Triune God so that she is enabled to use her gifts in ministry to the people of the world."
There is never a perfect time to start an organization like the LWML, but could we have chosen a time more challenging than *1942*?
The world had been at war for three years and the United States
had joined the effort in 1941.
Rations were short, many young---and older!---men were preparing to
fight overseas.
Women were entering the workforce to fill the vacancies left by the new soldiers.
The circumstances were challenging, to say the least!
I have never lived in such challenging circumstances!
Yet, on July 7-8, 1942, over 100 women---among them twenty-eight formal delegates---met in Chicago and established the LWML.
Its purpose was to encourage a greater consciousness among women for "missionary education, missionary inspiration, and missionary service."
It also decided to gather funds for mission projects above and beyond the Synod’s budget.
Did you not know that God *specializes* in finding his children of low estate and using especially *them* to manifest His love and power?
From this humble beginning---and through the use of the now familiar "Mite Boxes"---the League has blessed the mission efforts of
congregations, districts, and synod in *amazingly powerful ways*!
But there is more, as LWML historian Marlys Taege Moburg has captured it so well:

>  ... the blessing of the LWML, now also known as *Lutheran Women in Mission*, goes far beyond the millions raised for missions. Its benefits can be seen in faith deepened through Bible studies, in confidence built through leadership training, in the befriending of career missionaries, in blankets and clothing gathered for the impoverished, in food shared with the hungry and, above all, in the friendships nurtured and the lives changed by sharing the love of Jesus Christ.

“Time marches on,” as we all know so well, and it seems that as we age it marches at the double
quick. The Lutheran confession has always struggled against the intrusion of false teaching. But the
Lord has been faithful and has raised up faithful pastors like Timothy who have preached the pure
Gospel of Jesus Christ crucified for our sins and raised for our justification. And the Lord has gathered
faithful men, women, and children who have carried out the work of the Lord with zeal and devotion,
meeting the challenges and opportunities to reach out to those who need to hear the Gospel. Simply put,
our faithful God keeps His promises and we pray this Sunday and always that He will always enable us
to be ready to confess Christ, in whom we trust.
AMEN.
