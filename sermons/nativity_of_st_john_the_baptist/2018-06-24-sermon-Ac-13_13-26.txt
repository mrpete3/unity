## Old Testament [Is 40:1-5 ESV]

> [1] Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.\
> [2] Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,\
> and cry to her that her warfare is ended,\
> that her iniquity is pardoned,\
> that she has received from the Lord's hand\
> double for all her sins.

> [3] A voice cries:\
> “In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord;\
> make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\
> [4] Every valley shall be lifted up,\
> and every mountain and hill be made low;\
> the uneven ground shall become level,\
> and the rough places a plain.\
> [5] And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\
> and all flesh shall see it together,\
> for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”

## Epistle [Ac 13:13‑26 ESV; sermon text]

[13] Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem, [14] but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. [15] After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it.” [16] So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:

“Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. [17] The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. [18] And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. [19] And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. [20] All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. [21] Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. [22] And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, ‘I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’ [23] Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. [24] Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. [25] And as John was finishing his course, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’

[26] "Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation."

[13] Ἀναχθέντες δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Πάφου οἱ περὶ Παῦλον ἦλθον εἰς Πέργην τῆς Παμφυλίας: Ἰωάννης δὲ ἀποχωρήσας ἀπ' αὐτῶν ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα. 
[14] αὐτοὶ δὲ διελθόντες ἀπὸ τῆς Πέργης παρεγένοντο εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν τὴν Πισιδίαν, καὶ [εἰς]ελθόντες εἰς τὴν συναγωγὴν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων ἐκάθισαν. 
[15] μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἀνάγνωσιν τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν ἀπέστειλαν οἱ ἀρχισυνάγωγοι πρὸς αὐτοὺς λέγοντες, Ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί, εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἐν ὑμῖν λόγος παρακλήσεως πρὸς τὸν λαόν, λέγετε. 
[16] ἀναστὰς δὲ Παῦλος καὶ κατασείσας τῇ χειρὶ εἶπεν:

 Ἄνδρες Ἰσραηλῖται καὶ οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν θεόν, ἀκούσατε. 
[17] ὁ θεὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου Ἰσραὴλ ἐξελέξατο τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸν λαὸν ὕψωσεν ἐν τῇ παροικίᾳ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ μετὰ βραχίονος ὑψηλοῦ ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἐξ αὐτῆς, 
[18] καὶ ὡς τεσσερακονταετῆ χρόνον ἐτροποφόρησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, 
[19] καὶ καθελὼν ἔθνη ἑπτὰ ἐν γῇ Χανάαν κατεκληρονόμησεν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν 
[20] ὡς ἔτεσιν τετρακοσίοις καὶ πεντήκοντα. καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἔδωκεν κριτὰς ἕως Σαμουὴλ [τοῦ] προφήτου. 
[21] κἀκεῖθεν ᾐτήσαντο βασιλέα, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ θεὸς τὸν Σαοὺλ υἱὸν Κίς, ἄνδρα ἐκ φυλῆς Βενιαμίν, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα. 
[22] καὶ μεταστήσας αὐτὸν ἤγειρεν τὸν Δαυὶδ αὐτοῖς εἰς βασιλέα, ᾧ καὶ εἶπεν μαρτυρήσας, Εὗρον Δαυὶδ τὸν τοῦ Ἰεσσαί, ἄνδρα κατὰ τὴν καρδίαν μου, ὃς ποιήσει πάντα τὰ θελήματά μου. 
[23] τούτου ὁ θεὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματος κατ' ἐπαγγελίαν ἤγαγεν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ σωτῆρα Ἰησοῦν, 
[24] προκηρύξαντος Ἰωάννου πρὸ προσώπου τῆς εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ βάπτισμα μετανοίας παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραήλ. 
[25] ὡς δὲ ἐπλήρου Ἰωάννης τὸν δρόμον, ἔλεγεν, Τί ἐμὲ ὑπονοεῖτε εἶναι; οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐγώ: ἀλλ' ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται μετ' ἐμὲ οὗ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἄξιος τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν λῦσαι. 

[26] Ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί, υἱοὶ γένους Ἀβραὰμ καὶ οἱ ἐν ὑμῖν φοβούμενοι τὸν θεόν, ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος τῆς σωτηρίας ταύτης ἐξαπεστάλη.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 1:57‑80 ESV]

[57] Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. [58] And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. [59] And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, [60] but his mother answered, “No; he shall be called John.” [61] And they said to her, “None of your relatives is called by this name.” [62] And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. [63] And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they all wondered. [64] And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. [65] And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, [66] and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the hand of the Lord was with him.

[67] And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,

[68] “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
    for he has visited and redeemed his people
[69] and has raised up a horn of salvation for us
    in the house of his servant David,
[70] as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
[71] that we should be saved from our enemies
    and from the hand of all who hate us;
[72] to show the mercy promised to our fathers
    and to remember his holy covenant,
[73] the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us
[74] that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,
might serve him without fear,
[75] in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
[76] And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;
    for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
[77] to give knowledge of salvation to his people
    in the forgiveness of their sins,
[78] because of the tender mercy of our God,
    whereby the sunrise shall visit us[a] from on high
[79] to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
    to guide our feet into the way of peace.”

[80] And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

## Collect

Almighty God, through John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, You once proclaimed salvation. Now grant that we may know this salvation and serve You in holiness and righteousness all the days of our life; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Prayer for Separated Families[^1]

[^1]: Prayer supplied by the Synod.

Heavenly Father, You are our great provider and protector. Be with families throughout our world who are facing difficulties and separation. Comfort and bless children separated from their parents. Guide all parents in their calling to care for their children in obedience to You. Give the governing authorities the wisdom to make and enforce just laws that foster security and the common good, and to look with compassion and mercy on those who seek protection and provision. Strengthen those who work with immigrants and refugees with the endurance needed to fulfill their calling with compassion and wisdom. Grant insight, understanding and patience to the citizens of our nation as we wrestle with the many difficult and divisive issues that confront us daily. Draw all to the cross of Jesus, that the love of Your Son might reign over all things; through Christ Jesus, our Lord. Amen.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
What happened in the Bible after Pentecost? After all, this is the season of Pentecost.
On the day *of* Pentecost, the multitude gathered in Jerusalem was amazed at the pouring out of the Holy Spirit and His effect on the apostles---they spoke in tongues---foreign languages they had not studied.
The multitude asked Peter and the rest of the apostles,

> **“Brothers, what shall we do?” And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the _forgiveness of your sins_, and you will receive the _gift of the Holy Spirit_. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.”** ([Ac 2:37‑39 ESV](https://www.esv.org/Acts+2:37/))

> **Those who received [Peter's Word] were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.** ([Ac 2:41 ESV](https://www.esv.org/Acts+2:41/))

What happened *on* Pentecost?
Not only were the apostles filled with the gift Holy Spirit, but so were the three thousand souls who were baptized.
What happened *after* Pentecost?
Many more were baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit, as has continued to this day.

Were new Christians always baptized before they received the Holy Spirit?
No.
Some *were* baptized before ([Ac 8:12‑17](https://www.esv.org/Acts+8:12/)) but others were baptized after having received the gift of the Holy Spirit ([Ac 10:44‑48](https://www.esv.org/Acts+10:44/)).
But---and note this well---in all cases the Holy Spirit and Baptism went hand-in-hand ([Ac 9:17‑18](https://www.esv.org/Acts+9:17/))---there is no record in the book of Acts of Holy Spirit without Baptism---I mean *Christian* Baptism, not the Baptism of John the Baptist.

There were, you may recall, believers in Ephesus that St. Paul visited on his third missionary journey, but they had not yet received the gift Holy Spirit.

> **And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They said, “Into John's baptism.” And Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.” On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.** ([Ac 19:1‑6](https://www.esv.org/Acts+19:1/) ESV)

Note well, beloved in the Lord, that when St. Paul found out that the Ephesian believers had not received the gift the Holy Spirit, he directed them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, which is greater than the baptism of John the Baptist.
(Poor John the Baptist!)
He also laid his hands on them and they were filled with the Holy Spirit.
It bears to reason that since the Holy Spirit is a gift to be received with Baptism, then Baptism is also a gift.
Regard your Baptism and the Holy Spirit as a gift from God.

It is also worth underlining that before anyone received the Holy Spirit or was baptized, there was a preacher, whether an apostle (Ac 10:44‑48) or another Christian, like the deacon Philip (Ac 8:12‑17).

But poor John the Baptist!
Now that Jesus is ascended and the Holy Spirit is poured out with Baptism, John's baptism is not worth much anymore.
Really---it is unnecessary.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
