> [8] “And now, go, write it before them on a tablet\
> and inscribe it in a book,\
> that it may be for the time to come\
> as a witness forever.\
> [9] For they are a rebellious people,\
> lying children,\
> children unwilling to hear\
> the instruction of the LORD;\
> [10] who say to the seers, “Do not see,”\
> and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us what is right;\
> speak to us smooth things,\
> prophesy illusions,\
> [11] leave the way, turn aside from the path,\
> let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.”\
> [12] Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,\
> “Because you despise this word\
> and trust in oppression and perverseness\
> and rely on them,\
> [13] therefore this iniquity shall be to you\
> like a breach in a high wall, bulging out and about to collapse,\
> whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant;\
> [14] and its breaking is like that of a potter's vessel\
> that is smashed so ruthlessly\
> that among its fragments not a shard is found\
> with which to take fire from the hearth,\
> or to dip up water out of the cistern.”\


> [15] For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel,\
> “In returning and rest you shall be saved;\
> in quietness and in trust shall be your strength.”\
> But you were unwilling, [16] and you said,\
> “No! We will flee upon horses”;\
> therefore you shall flee away;\
> and, “We will ride upon swift steeds”;\
> therefore your pursuers shall be swift.\
> [17] A thousand shall flee at the threat of one;\
> at the threat of five you shall flee,\
> till you are left\
> like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain,\
> like a signal on a hill.\

## Epistle [Rm 8:31b‑39 ESV]

[31b] If God is for us, who can be against us? [32] He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? [33] Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. [34] Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. [35] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? [36] As it is written,

> “For your sake we are being killed all the day long;\
> we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”

[37] No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. [38] For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, [39] nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 12:35‑40 ESV; sermon text]

[35] “Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, [36] and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks. [37] Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them. [38] If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants! [39] But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. [40] You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, I hope you all had a Merry Christmas,
and I hope that you all will have a blessed New Year in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Christmas was by any measure a busy time of the year.
Many of you, I am sure, were in high gear for Christmas.
Why is it that people are busier around Christmas than they are the rest of the year?
Well, there is certainly an air of *expectation* about Christmas. Christmas is coming! Get ready!
Send Christmas cards! Organize Christmas dinner! Cook Christmas dinner!
Get the family together for Christmas dinner!
That is enough to keep you busy, and I have not even mentioned the business of Christmas presents.
Speaking of busy, can you imagine what it is like to work for UPS during the Christmas season, helping Santa deliver all those presents?
Busy. Expectation---expectation that Christmas will be a time to feel special.
And for the sake of Christ our Lord being born for sinners at Christmas, it *should* make you feel very special.

But now it is time for a break---it is now time to take a break after another busy Christmas.
After the strain, it is time to kick back and take it easy for a while.
But if it is time for a break, why are you going to stay up till midnight tonight?
What is so urgent that you cannot rest tonight after a busy Christmas?
Why, it is New Year's Eve.
It is time to have fun one more time---it is time to throw one more party---it is time to have fun and ring in the New Year.
But, beloved in the Lord, please do not tell me that you are going to finally *rest tomorrow morning* and miss church! Jesus will be waiting for you; New Year's Eve is not a good excuse to miss church on New Year's Day.

For you will hear at church of the babe of Bethlehem who was born to give you real rest.

> **Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. ... and you will find rest for your souls.** [(Mt 11:28‑29 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2011%3A28-29/)

The rest proclaimed tomorrow---the Sabbath proclaimed every Sunday---the rest I proclaim to you even tonight---is the burden of sin lifted from your shoulders by the work of Jesus Christ our Lord.
*[Illustration]* In the spirit of busy expectation, allow me to illustrate.
Suppose you were busy getting ready not for Christmas, but for a wedding---your own wedding.
(Some of you may remember getting ready for your own wedding.)
You are busy, with expectation building for the big day---your wedding day.
Furthermore, your wedding will be held in a church in Marietta, Ohio, behind the Ohio River levee.
You are doing your best---you are making every effort to make your wedding the best, but you cannot control the weather.
You prepare for the weather---you put up a tent for the reception---but you cannot control the weather.
And what do you know:
three days before your wedding it pours and the Ohio River rises.
Two days before your wedding it pours again and the river rises even more, and at this point the Ohio River levee is holding the water back from flooding the town.
Oh no!
The day before your wedding it pours *again*! And you are in trouble.
Three days of downpour is all the levee is built for; it is about to break on your wedding day.
The river is moving swiftly by the levee; the top of the river is only a foot from the top of the levee.
If that levee breaks, you know your perfectly planned wedding will be washed out, and what a shame!

Our Old Testament reading tonight, from Isaiah, chapter 30 serves to warn us about the flood of our iniquity and sin that weakens the wall that protects us and threatens to ruin our wedding with Jesus on the day of His return.

> **For they are a rebellious people,**\
> **lying children,**\
> **children unwilling to hear**\
> **the instruction of the LORD.** [(Is 30:9 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2030%3A9/)

We confess before to our heavenly Father tonight that in 2016, we were at times unwilling to hear his instruction: **Honor your father and your mother. You shall not steal. You shall not commit adultery (even in your mind). Love your enemies and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return** (Lk 6:35).
Were our sins to flow without God's intervention, the levee would have broken in 2016 and we would be washed away with guilt and shame.

> **Therefore this iniquity shall be to you**\
> **like a breach in a high wall, bulging out and about to collapse,**\
> **whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant.**\ [(Is 30:13 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah%2030%3A13/)

But, beloved in the Lord, we must rejoice that our Lord's Crucifixion also played a big role on our behalf in 2016, for we were not good enough by our best efforts to keep the river behind the levee.
Every time the levee was about to break, our punishment, demanded by God's holy Law, was proclaimed in all its sternness.
Before the levee broke, our hearts trembled at what would happen to us if we were washed away by our flood of sins.
Our trembling hearts then heard our faithful preacher proclaim that *our Lord Jesus* died on the Cross *in our place, for our sins*---**by His wounds we are healed**.
By His wounds, like magic, a heavenly channel appeared to drain the flooding river till the riverbed was dry and our sins were forgotten; all that remained were birds singing in the trees by the old, dry riverbed.

Beloved in the Lord, we are about to participate together in Holy Communion---*the true body and blood of Christ, given and shed for us for the forgiveness of our sins*.
This is the best possible way to wrap up the old year of sin---with our sins, no matter how dreadful, forgiven in the name of Jesus---our bodies and souls strengthened by His true body and blood, with which He mercifully feeds us sinners so that we do not die in our sins, but are forgvien and live forever---a foretaste of the heavenly wedding banquet to come on the day of His return.

Unless things change quickly in the next few hours---and they certainly could---it appears that Jesus will not have returned in 2016 to claim His bride, His Church, and take us to heaven.
But, gracious Father, give us Your Holy Spirit that we be on our toes, eagerly expecting His return in 2017!
Help us, Father, to take a break every day by faith in Your dear Son Jesus for the forgiveness of our sins.
By faith in Your Word, lift for us every day the burden of our sins, and may we praise the name of Jesus for not having our burden anymore, which had threatened to crush us but threatens us no more---turn away for us every day the flooding river of our sins, which had threatened to break our levee but threatens us no more.
And, gracious Father, by faith in our forgiveness in the name of Jesus, keep us busy---awake and on our toes, eagerly expecting the day of His return---investing those talents that You gave us [(Mt 25:14‑30)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2025%3A14-30/)---keeping oil in our lamps so that they are lit when our Bridegroom returns [(Mt 25:1‑13)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2025%3A1-13/).
Let that day be for us *the* wedding day---the only day that matters.
Help us, dear God, heavenly Father, to let not a day be wasted preparing for that day!
AMEN.

## Outline

|       TAKE A BREAK OR STAY AWAKE?         |

1. Take a break after the holidays
    1. Christmas was busy.
    1. We will stay up late tonight, but for what purpose?
1. Stay awake waiting for Jesus
    1. He *is* our rest.
        1. Rest by the forgiveness of sin.
        1. Take a break from guilt, shame.
    1. Yet He tells us to stay awake.
        1. Stay awake means take a break from listening to the devil.
        1. If you keep listening to him, your levee will break.
        1. Expectation as for a wedding
	1. He is the Bridegroom and we are His Bride
	    1. Our engagement was when He died on the Cross, and He asks, “Will you be mine?”
	    1. When He comes, He expects us to be ready.

## Notes

Is 30:13. This suggests and illustration of a breaking levee.

Is 30:14. The consequence of the breaking is worthlessness.
