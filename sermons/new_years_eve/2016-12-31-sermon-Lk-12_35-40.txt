## First reading [Is 30:8‑17 ESV]

> [8] “And now, go, write it before them on a tablet\
> and inscribe it in a book,\
> that it may be for the time to come\
> as a witness forever.\
> [9] For they are a rebellious people,\
> lying children,\
> children unwilling to hear\
> the instruction of the LORD;\
> [10] who say to the seers, “Do not see,”\
> and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us what is right;\
> speak to us smooth things,\
> prophesy illusions,\
> [11] leave the way, turn aside from the path,\
> let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.”\
> [12] Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,\
> “Because you despise this word\
> and trust in oppression and perverseness\
> and rely on them,\
> [13] therefore this iniquity shall be to you\
> like a breach in a high wall, bulging out and about to collapse,\
> whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant;\
> [14] and its breaking is like that of a potter's vessel\
> that is smashed so ruthlessly\
> that among its fragments not a shard is found\
> with which to take fire from the hearth,\
> or to dip up water out of the cistern.”\


> [15] For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel,\
> “In returning and rest you shall be saved;\
> in quietness and in trust shall be your strength.”\
> But you were unwilling, [16] and you said,\
> “No! We will flee upon horses”;\
> therefore you shall flee away;\
> and, “We will ride upon swift steeds”;\
> therefore your pursuers shall be swift.\
> [17] A thousand shall flee at the threat of one;\
> at the threat of five you shall flee,\
> till you are left\
> like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain,\
> like a signal on a hill.\

## Epistle [Rm 8:31b‑39 ESV]

[31b] If God is for us, who can be against us? [32] He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? [33] Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. [34] Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. [35] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? [36] As it is written,

> “For your sake we are being killed all the day long;\
> we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”

[37] No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. [38] For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, [39] nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 12:35‑40 ESV; sermon text]

[35] “Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, [36] and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks. [37] Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them. [38] If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants! [39] But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. [40] You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”

## Introit [Ps 98:1-3; antiphon: Ps 124:8]

> Our help is in the name | of the LORD,\*\
> who made | heaven and earth.\
> Oh sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done | marvelous things!\*\
> His right hand and his holy arm have worked salva- | tion for him.\
> The LORD has made known his sal- | vation;\*\
> he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the | nations.\
> He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of | Israel.\*\
> All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation | of our God.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, I hope you all had a Merry Christmas,
and I hope that you all will have a blessed New Year in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Christmas is by any measure a busy time of the year.
Many of you, I am sure, were in high gear for Christmas.
Why is it that people are busier around Christmas than they are the rest of the year?
There is certainly an air of *expectation*: “Christmas is coming and I need to be ready.
I need to send Christmas cards. I need to contact everyone to come over for Christmas dinner. I need to organize Christmas dinner. I need to *cook* Christmas dinner. Hey, sister, can you bring a casserole? Hey, brother, can you bring the potatoes? I'll cook the turkey.”
That is enough to keep you busy, and I have not even mentioned presents.
Can you imagine what it is like to work for UPS during the Christmas season, helping Santa deliver all those presents?
Busy. Expectation---expectation that Christmas will be a time for everyone to feel special.
And for the sake of Christ our Lord being born for sinners at Christmas, it *should* make everyone feel very special.

But it is now time to take a break after another busy Christmas.
After the strain, it is time to kick back and take it easy for a while.
Yet why are you going to stay up till midnight tonight if it is time to kick back and take it easy for a while?
What is so urgent that you cannot rest tonight?
Why, it is New Year's Eve.
It is time to have fun one more time and ring in the New Year.
But please do not tell me that you are going to finally rest tomorrow morning and miss church.

For you will hear at church of the babe of Bethlehem who was born to give you spiritual rest.

> **Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. ... and you will find rest for your souls.** [(Mt 11:28‑29 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2011%3A28-29/)



AMEN.

## Outline

|       TAKE A BREAK OR STAY AWAKE?         |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|

1. Take a break after the holidays
    1. Christmas was busy.
    1. We will stay up late tonight, but for what purpose?
1. Stay awake waiting for Jesus
    1. He *is* our rest.
        1. Rest by the forgiveness of sin.
        1. Take a break from guilt, shame.
    1. Yet He tells us to stay awake.
        1. Stay awake means take a break from listening to the devil.
        1. If you keep listening to him, your levee will break.
        1. Expectation as for a wedding
	1. He is the Bridegroom and we are His Bride
	    1. Our engagement was when He died on the Cross, and He asks, “Will you be mine?”
	    1. When He comes, He expects us to be ready.

## Notes

Is 30:13. This suggests and illustration of a breaking levee.

Is 30:14. The consequence of the breaking is worthlessness.
