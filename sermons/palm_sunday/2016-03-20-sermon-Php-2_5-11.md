## Old Testament [Dt 32:36‑39 ESV]
[36]For the Lord will vindicate his people  
>and have compassion on his servants,  
>when he sees that their power is gone  
>and there is none remaining, bond or free.  
[37]Then he will say, ‘Where are their gods,  
>the rock in which they took refuge,  
[38] who ate the fat of their sacrifices  
>and drank the wine of their drink offering?  
>Let them rise up and help you;  
>let them be your protection!  
[39[ “‘See now that I, even I, am he,  
>and there is no god beside me;  
>I kill and I make alive;  
>I wound and I heal;  
>and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.


## Epistle [Php 2:5‑11 ESV; sermon text]
[5] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, [6] who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, [7] but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. [8] And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. [9] Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, [10] so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, [11] and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.


## Holy Gospel [Lk 22:1‑23 ESV]
[22:1] Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover. [2] And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people.
[3] Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve. [4] He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. [5] And they were glad, and agreed to give him money. [6] So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.
[7] Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. [8] So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.” [9] They said to him, “Where will you have us prepare it?” [10] He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters [11] and tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ [12] And he will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare it there.” [13] And they went and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
[14] And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him. [15] And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. [16] For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” [17] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves. [18] For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” [19] And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” [20] And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. [21] But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. [22] For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!” [23] And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this.


## Introit [Ps 24:7-10; antiphon: Ps 118:26]

> Blessèd is he who comes in the name | of the LORD!*  
> We bless you from the house | of the LORD.
> Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O | ancient doors,*
> that the King of glory | may come in.
> Who is this King of | glory?* 
> The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in | battle! 
> Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O | ancient doors,*
> that the King of glory | may come in.
> Who is this King of | glory?*
> The LORD of hosts, he is the King of| glory!
> Blessèd is he who comes in the name | of the LORD!*
> We bless you from the house | of the LORD.


	

## Collect

Almighty and everlasting God, You sent Your Son, our Savior Jesus Christ, to take upon Himself our flesh and to suffer death upon the cross. Mercifully grant that we may follow the example of His great humility and patience and be made partakers of His resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
