## Old Testament [Is 50:4‑9a ESV]

> [4] The Lord GOD has given me\
> the tongue of those who are taught,\
> that I may know how to sustain with a word\
> him who is weary.\
> Morning by morning he awakens;\
> he awakens my ear\
> to hear as those who are taught.\
> [5] The Lord GOD has opened my ear,\
> and I was not rebellious;\
> I turned not backward.\
> [6] I gave my back to those who strike,\
> and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard;\
> I hid not my face\
> from disgrace and spitting.

> [7] But the Lord GOD helps me;\
> therefore I have not been disgraced;\
> therefore I have set my face like a flint,\
> and I know that I shall not be put to shame.\
> [8] 	He who vindicates me is near.\
> Who will contend with me?\
> Let us stand up together.\
> Who is my adversary?\
> Let him come near to me.\
> [9] Behold, the Lord GOD helps me;\
> who will declare me guilty?

## Epistle [Php 2:5‑11 ESV]

[5] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, [6] who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, [7] but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. [8] And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. [9] Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, [10] so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, [11] and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 12:12‑19 ESV; sermon text]

[12] The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. [13] So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” [14] And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,

> [15] “Fear not, daughter of Zion;\
> behold, your king is coming,\
> sitting on a donkey's colt!”
	
[16] His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him. [17] The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness. [18] The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. [19] So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him.”

[12] Τῇ ἐπαύριον ὁ ὄχλος πολὺς ὁ ἐλθὼν εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν, ἀκούσαντες ὅτι ἔρχεται ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, 
[13] ἔλαβον τὰ βαΐα τῶν φοινίκων καὶ ἐξῆλθον εἰς ὑπάντησιν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐκραύγαζον, Ὡσαννά: εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου, [καὶ] ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. 
[14] εὑρὼν δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὀνάριον ἐκάθισεν ἐπ' αὐτό, καθώς ἐστιν γεγραμμένον, 

> [15] Μὴ φοβοῦ, θυγάτηρ Σιών: ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεύς σου ἔρχεται, καθήμενος ἐπὶ πῶλον ὄνου.

[16] ταῦτα οὐκ ἔγνωσαν αὐτοῦ οἱ μαθηταὶ τὸ πρῶτον, ἀλλ' ὅτε ἐδοξάσθη Ἰησοῦς τότε ἐμνήσθησαν ὅτι ταῦτα ἦν ἐπ' αὐτῷ γεγραμμένα καὶ ταῦτα ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ. 
[17] ἐμαρτύρει οὖν ὁ ὄχλος ὁ ὢν μετ' αὐτοῦ ὅτε τὸν Λάζαρον ἐφώνησεν ἐκ τοῦ μνημείου καὶ ἤγειρεν αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν. 
[18] διὰ τοῦτο [καὶ] ὑπήντησεν αὐτῷ ὁ ὄχλος ὅτι ἤκουσαν τοῦτο αὐτὸν πεποιηκέναι τὸ σημεῖον. 
[19] οἱ οὖν Φαρισαῖοι εἶπαν πρὸς ἑαυτούς, Θεωρεῖτε ὅτι οὐκ ὠφελεῖτε οὐδέν: ἴδε ὁ κόσμος ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ἀπῆλθεν.

## Collect

Almighty and gracious Lord, You sent Your Son, our Savior Jesus Christ, to take upon Himself our flesh and to suffer death upon the cross. Mercifully grant that we may follow the example of His great humility and patience and be made partakers of His resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, the road you must take to achieve something is often a long road; it is not an easy road to take.
For example, I respect all of you who have worked hard for your adult life and are now retired.
Nice job! Take a break.
Everything you went through to get to retirement---the road you took in your working life---that road was not easy.
Getting up to get to work on time, getting more and more work piled on you, dealing with supervisors who did not supervise, worrying about layoffs, *getting* laid off, looking for work---year after year it was always something but the time came when you realized, "I don't have many more years to go."
All your work has paid off and now you enjoy your well-deserved retirement.

After your retirement, what if you were to face one more road: the road to redemption from your sins.
You have one more road for travel---do you have it in you?--- one more road and when you get to the end of it, you are redeemed from your sins---all your sins are forgiven.
What would it take to travel that road?
What would it be compared to your career in the workforce?
How many years in purgatory---pretend for a moment that purgatory really exists---how many years would you have to work before you could retire from your sins and go to heaven?
Okay, if purgatory would take too long, how many years in hell---now hell *is* real---how many years would you have to suffer to work off your sins?
Frankly, I am afraid that that comparison is greater than our minds can bear and that that road to redemption that none of us could finish.
Compared to the road to retirement, the road to redemption from your sins would simply be awful.

Beloved in the Lord, whatever that road is---the road to redemption from your sins---you do not have to take it---it is too much work.
For on Palm Sunday, your Lord Jesus takes that road for you.
Oh, there is so much to say about your Lord Jesus; there is so much to say that we come to church every Sunday to hear about Him again and again.
Hear what Isaiah says about Him today in our Old Testament lesson:

> **The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught.**

Yet before He teaches,

> **The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious.** [(Is 50:4‑5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+50/)

Before He opened His mouth and taught us, **"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,"** He opened His ear and was obedient to the Word of His Father.

> **"I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me."** [(Jn 8:28b ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+8/)

The Word from Christ's tongue alone is worth coming to church every Sunday.
After hearing His Word in church, many of us go to Bible study and and Sunday School to hear some more.

But on Palm Sunday, as excellent of a teacher and encourager as He is, Jesus does not come to Jerusalem so much to preach, but to *work*.

> **“Fear not, daughter of Zion;**\
> **behold, your king is coming,**\
> **sitting on a donkey's colt!”**

The donkey is a beast of burden: Jesus has come to *work*.
His work is to take the road to redeem you from your sins.
How long will it take?

> **Behold, I will bring my servant the Branch. ... and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a _single day_.** [(Zec 3:8‑9 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+3/)

When you see the palm branches on Palm Sunday, remember that Jesus is the Branch who comes to work---to work off your sins, to work off my sins, to work off the sins of the whole land *in a single day*.
How long would it take you to redeem you from your sins?
Too long, too much to imagine.
How long will it take *Jesus* to redeem you from your sins?
One day.

Jesus may appear to come in weakness, meekness, and lowliness, but He comes with unimaginable strength to take that road for you for your redemption from sin.
AMEN.
