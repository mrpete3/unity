## Old Testament [Zechariah 9:9-12 ESV]

>

## Epistle [Philippians 2:5â€‘11 ESV]

[5] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, [6] who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, [7] but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. [8] And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. [9] Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, [10] so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, [11] and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

## Holy Gospel [Mark 14:1-25 ESV; sermon text]




## Introit [Ps 24:7-10; antiphon: Ps 118:26]

> Blessed is he who comes in the name | of the LORD!\*\
> We bless you from the house | of the LORD.\
> Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O | ancient doors,\*\
> that the King of glory | may come in.\
> Who is this King of | glory?\*\
> The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in | battle!\
> Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O | ancient doors,\*\
> that the King of glory | may come in.\
> Who is this King of | glory?\*\
> The LORD of hosts, he is the King of | glory!\
> Blessed is he who comes in the name | of the LORD!\*\
> We bless you from the house | of the LORD.\


## Collect

Almighty and everlasting God, You sent Your Son, our Savior Jesus Christ, to take upon Himself our flesh and to suffer death upon the cross. Mercifully grant that we may follow the example of His great humility and patience and be made partakers of His resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
