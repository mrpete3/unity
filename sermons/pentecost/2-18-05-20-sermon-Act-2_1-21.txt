## First Reading [Ezekiel 37:1-14]

[37:1] The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones. [2] And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry.
[3] And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord God, you know.” [4] Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
[5] Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. [6] And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin,
and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.”
[7] So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came
together, bone to its bone. [8] And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin 
had covered them. But there was no breath in them. [9] Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and
say to the breath, Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”
[10] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly
great army.
[11] Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up,
and our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.’ [12] Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will 
open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel. [13] And you shall 
know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. [14] And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the Lord.”

## Epistle Reading [Acts 2:1-21]

[2:1] When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. [2] And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. 
[3] And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. [4] And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.
[5] Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. [6] And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in
his own language. [7] And they were amazed and astonished, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? [8] And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? [9] Parthians and Medes and Elamites
and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, [10] Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, [11] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear
them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.” [12] And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” [13] But others mocking said, “They are filled with new wine.”
[14] But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. [15] For these people are not drunk,
as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. [16] But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:
[17] “‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares,
that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
    and your young men shall see visions,
    and your old men shall dream dreams;
[18] even on my male servants and female servants
    in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.
[19] And I will show wonders in the heavens above
    and signs on the earth below,
    blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;
[20] the sun shall be turned to darkness
    and the moon to blood,
    before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.
[21] And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’ 

## Holy Gospel [Jn 15:26-27, 16:4b-15 ESV]

[26] “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. 
[27] And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.
[16:4b] “I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. [5] But now I am going to him who sent me, 
and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ [6] But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. [7] Nevertheless,
I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. 
[8] And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: [9] concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; [10] 
concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; [11] concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
[12] “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. [13] When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will
not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. [14] He will glorify me, for he will take
what is mine and declare it to you. [15] All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

## Collect

O God, on this day You once taught the hearts of Your faithful people by sending them the light of Your Holy Spirit.

one God, now and forever.
