## First Reading [Ezekiel 37:1-14]

[37:1] The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones. [2] And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry.
[3] And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord God, you know.” [4] Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
[5] Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. [6] And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin,
and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.”

[7] So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came
together, bone to its bone. [8] And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin 
had covered them. But there was no breath in them. [9] Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and
say to the breath, Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”
[10] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly
great army.

[11] Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up,
and our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.’ [12] Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will 
open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel. [13] And you shall 
know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. [14] And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the Lord.”

## Epistle Reading [Acts 2:1-21]

[2:1] When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. [2] And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. 
[3] And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. [4] And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.

[5] Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. [6] And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in
his own language. [7] And they were amazed and astonished, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? [8] And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? [9] Parthians and Medes and Elamites
and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, [10] Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, [11] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear
them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.” [12] And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” [13] But others mocking said, “They are filled with new wine.”

[14] But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. [15] For these people are not drunk,
as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. [16] But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:

> **[17] And in the last days it shall be, God declares,**\
> **that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,**\
> **and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,**\
> **and your young men shall see visions,**\
> **and your old men shall dream dreams;**\
> **[18] even on my male servants and female servants**\
> **in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.**\
> **[19] And I will show wonders in the heavens above**\
> **and signs on the earth below,**\
> **blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;**\
> **[20] the sun shall be turned to darkness**\
> **and the moon to blood,**\
> **before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.**\
> **[21] And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.**

## Holy Gospel [Jn 15:26-27, 16:4b-15 ESV]

[26] “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. 
[27] And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.

[16:4b] “I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. [5] But now I am going to him who sent me, 
and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ [6] But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. [7] Nevertheless,
I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. 
[8] And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: [9] concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; [10] 
concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; [11] concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.

[12] “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. [13] When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will
not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. [14] He will glorify me, for he will take
what is mine and declare it to you. [15] All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

## Introit [Ps 104:24, 27-28,30; antiphon: Liturgical Text]

## Collect

O God, on this day You once taught the hearts of Your faithful people by sending them the light of Your Holy Spirit.
Grant us in our day by the same Spirit to have a right understanding in all things and evermore to rejoice in His
holy consolation; through the same Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
The biggest day of the church year has got to be Easter Sunday; Easter was seven weeks ago.
When taken together with Good Friday, how can you beat the end of Holy Week and the celebration of our Lord's Resurrection?
How can you beat the sunrise service, the Easter breakfast, and the church decked out with Easter lilies and the congregation singing, *Jesus Christ is ris'n today, Alleuluia!*?
You cannot beat it; that is why Easter is the biggest day of the church year.

Second place, though, has got to be Christmas. 
If you were not here for Shirley Prokop's funeral, we sang *Silent Night* at her funeral because she had requested to sing it while she was under hospice care at Holy Family.
The nun had come to her asking what she wanted to sing, and Shirley wanted to sing *Silent Night*, so we sang it at her funeral, too.
Two days ago, Joe G., the youth, and I went to visit Ruth Sommerfeld at the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky.
We had Holy Communion in her room, sang a Pentecost hymn, and then we sang *Silent Night*, of course, which Ruth knows word-for-word.
Trevon, as a matter of fact, knows *Silent Night* word-for-word because he was there singing it in Ruth's room.
Many of you, no doubt, know *Silent Night* word-for-word.
Could it be that *Silent Night* is the best-known hymn in Christendom?
I believe it is.
Christmas is big.

Third place is Pentecost.
Not that it deserves to be in third place---maybe is should be in second. Lord knows.
Beloved in the Lord, history changed on Pentecost because the Holy Spirit had never before been poured out like it was on Pentecost.
We live in the post-Pentecost time---the age of the Holy Spirit.
*[Illustration]* We also live in the age of technology.
Years ago, we never carried our phones in our pockets and could not imagine taking pictures with them.
Today we do.
We live in the age of medicine.
Years ago, heart conditions were often fatal.
Today we have cardiologists, heart drugs, stents, valve replacements, pacemakers, and defibrillators.
We are surrounded by people who years ago would have died.
Years ago, before Pentecost, people lived without having the Holy Spirit like we do today.
Since it was two thousand years ago, none of us knows what it was like before Pentecost.
But maybe we do.

You and I do not know what it was like to live before the day of Pentecost, but we do know what it is like *to live without the Holy Spirit*.
God forbid, but we do know what it is like to live without the Holy Spirit.
If you want to find out, just ask Him to leave your heart.
I recommend that you *never* ask the Holy Spirit to leave, but *when you sin*, you ask the Holy Spirit to leave.
Pick a sin and just get into it, and you will find out what it is like to live without the Holy Spirit.

> **O you who love the LORD, hate evil!** [(Ps 97:10 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+97:10/)

"O you who hate the LORD, love evil."
When we embrace sin---and this is the danger of recurring sin---we hate the LORD---we do not want the Holy Spirit around.
*[Illustration]* A bunch of underage drinkers want to party, and there is one who says, "I can't drink: I'm under 21."
The drinkers make fun of him and make him feel uncomforatble and he leaves.
The Holy Spirit is *holy*---the Holy Spirit *hates* sin and leaves on His own when we cherish sin.

Take note, beloved in the Lord, that we sing the Offertory each Communion Sunday, which is taken right out of Psalm 51:

> **Create in me a clean heart, O God,**\
> **and renew a right spirit within me.**\
> **Cast me not away from Thy presence,**\
> **and _take not Thy Holy Spirit from me_.**

Open up your Bibles to the beginning of Psalm 51, and you will see that David wrote this psalm after he had confessed his sins of adultery and murder to Nathan the prophet.

> **Cast me not away from Thy presence,**\
> **and _take not Thy Holy Spirit from me_.**

David had picked a sin---coveting someone else's wife---and just got into it.
2 Samuel, chapter 11 records the sin of David with Bathsheba.
You know the story well.
David got carried away: he *thought* of committing adultery with Uriah's wife, Bathsheba, and then he got into it.
Where was the Holy Spirit then?
David's sin did not end with that; the Spirit was long gone and David's sin got worse.
Bathseba conceived a child, and what did David do?
King David told Joab, his general, Joab, to put Uriah, his soldier, in a battle where Uriah would be sure to die.
And sure enough, Joab gave the order for Uriah to be at the forefront of the hardest fighting at Rabbah, the city of the Ammonites.
The Ammonite archers shot from the city wall and Uriah died from the wound of an arrow.

David picked a sin and got into it.
The Holy Spirit left and it is plain to see that the devil told David what to do and David listened.
He did Satan's will, and terrible things happened.
David, the one who was not afraid to fight Goliath because he trusted in the God of Israel?
David, the one who would not kill King Saul even though Saul was trying to kill him?
David---the Spirit-filled man!
And David picked a sin and got into it, and the Holy Spirit left.[^1]
He remembers what it is like when he writes in Psalm 51, **"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me."**

[^1]: SA III (III), 43

You and I, though we did not live before the day of Pentecost, can remember well what it is like to live without the Holy Spirit if we ever picked a sin and got into it, like David.
Beloved in the Lord, repent!
Repentance is such a beautiful thing because the Holy Spirit returns to give life to your dead bones.
**"You were dead in your trespasses and sins,"** says St. Paul [(Eph 2:1)](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2:1/).
Dead in sin, you are no different from the dead bones in Ezekiel's valley.
Dead and dried up and unable to do anything except just lie there dead.
But the Word of the Lord is proclaimed to you:

> **"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead."** [(Ac 17:30‑31 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+17:30/)

> **"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. [39] For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself."** [(Ac 2:38‑39 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+2:38/)

You *are* forgiven your sins in the name of Jesus and you *have* the gift of the Holy Spirit just as sure as you were baptized, just as certain as Jesus has been raised from the dead.
You may know what it is like to not have the Holy Spirit, but you also know what it is like to have Him---to have Jesus living in your heart.
Pray for the Holy Spirit [(Lk 11:13)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+11:13/), and may He never leave you.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
