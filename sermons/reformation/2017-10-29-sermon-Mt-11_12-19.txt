## First Reading [Rv 14:6‑7 ESV]

[6] Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people. [7] And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.”

## Epistle [Rm 3:19‑28 ESV]

[19] Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. [20] For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

[21] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—[22] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

[27] Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. [28] For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 11:12‑19 ESV; sermon text]

[12] From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. [13] For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, [14] and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. [15] He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

[16] “But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,

> [17] “‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;\
> we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’
	
[18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ [19] The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.”

[13] πάντες γὰρ οἱ προφῆται καὶ ὁ νόμος ἕως Ἰωάννου ἐπροφήτευσαν: 
[14] καὶ εἰ θέλετε δέξασθαι, αὐτός ἐστιν Ἠλίας ὁ μέλλων ἔρχεσθαι. 
[15] ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκουέτω. 
[16] Τίνι δὲ ὁμοιώσω τὴν γενεὰν ταύτην; ὁμοία ἐστὶν παιδίοις καθημένοις ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς ἃ προσφωνοῦντα τοῖς ἑτέροις 
[17] λέγουσιν, Ηὐλήσαμεν ὑμῖν καὶ οὐκ ὠρχήσασθε: ἐθρηνήσαμεν καὶ οὐκ ἐκόψασθε. 
[18] ἦλθεν γὰρ Ἰωάννης μήτε ἐσθίων μήτε πίνων, καὶ λέγουσιν, Δαιμόνιον ἔχει: 
[19] ἦλθεν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐσθίων καὶ πίνων, καὶ λέγουσιν, Ἰδοὺ ἄνθρωπος φάγος καὶ οἰνοπότης, τελωνῶν φίλος καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν. καὶ ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῆς.

hear us.

Lord God, while we travel as pilgrims here on earth, give us comfort in
the knowledge that You have called us to be Your disciples through water and the Word. In the midst of difficult times, when waters roar and foam and mountains tremble, give us confidence in knowing that we have been set
free by the Son, and so we are free indeed! The Lord of hosts is with us;

**C:** the God of Jacob is our fortress.

**P:** Lord God, as Your children, we are called to love You, our neighbor, and even our enemy. Give us willing hearts to love our neighbor as ourselves because You first loved us. The Lord of hosts is with us;

The Lord of hosts is with us;

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, what about the violence in the world? For as much we enjoy peace, why is there violence at all? When will the vioence come to and end? When will the war be over?
You can count on your hand the number of people in the church today *[Lift up one finger for Virginia.]* who can remember the end of World War II.
I have only heard that World War II---where we fought Hitler's Germany in Europe and Hirohito's Japan in Asia---that World War II was a violent conflict that engulfed the whole world.
Soldiers died by violence in battle. Civilians died by violence at the hands of soldiers.
Satan was all over the world spreading lies and murder and in the lands where the war was fought, it smelled like rotting flesh.
Like I said, I was not there, but I heard of it, and for those who were there, or for those who lived here, I have no doubt that they *could not wait* for the violence to end.

I am bringing up violence today because our Lord Jesus begins our Holy Gospel today with these words:

> **From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force.**

Christ's Church on earth has suffered violence and the violent take it by force, and it has to do with the Reformation.
The Reformation---whose 500th anniversary we celebrate *today*---is a breakout of the kingdom of heaven on earth---a breakout of peace on earth---a preaching of the forgiveness of sins by faith alone, faith in Jesus' redemption on the Cross---but, nevertheless, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence.
I want to tie in for you today of two bits of Reformation and post-Reformation history that you may not know much about.
I do not know much about them, either, but I know they happened and they have to do with today's Holy Gospel.

* There was a war that happened during the Reformation: the Peasants' Rebellion.
* There was a ware that happened after the Reformation: the Thirty Years' War.

The Peasants' Rebellion happened right in the middle of the Reformation, from 1524‑1525.[^1]
The Diet of Worms was in 1521, when Luther took his stand on God's Word before the imperial diet and said, "I cannot and will not retract anything. ... Here I stand. God help me. Amen."
The main revelation of the Bible on which Luther stood was our Epistle reading:

[^1]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Peasants%27_War#Luther_and_M.C3.BCntzer), accessed 29 October 2017.

> **For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.** [(Rm 3:23‑26 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3/)

There are two main teachings of the Bible; the first one is that **all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God**.
We have all sinned at one time or another.
Or have we all sinned quite a few times?
Or is it possible that we are sin addicts?
Again, from Romans, chapter 3:

> **None is righteous, no, not one;**\
> **no one understands; no one seeks for God.**\
> **All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;**\
> **no one does good, not even one.”** [(Rm 3:10‑12 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3/)

No matter how good we try to think good of ourselves, God does declare us to be worthless sinners. That is *the Law*: the first main teaching of the Bible.

The second main teaching of the Bible is that you **are justified by [God's] grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.**
You may not use the word *propiation* in your daily speech, but maybe you should.
*Propiation* is what takes anger away; *propitiation* it what stops violence; *propitiation* means there is nothing to fight about anymore.
*Propitiation* means *peace*.
The second main teaching of the Bible *[Point to Crucifixion window.]* points to Christ's blood shed on the Cross as propitiation for your sins.
The Father sees His Son's blood and is not angry with you anymore; He invites you to believe in His Son's blood given and shed for you for the forgiveness of your sins.
*[Point to the altar.]* He then invites you to His table on a regular basis to drink with your own lips His Son's blood, shed for your for the forgiveness of your sins (Mt 26:28).
Holy Communion is a meal of propitiation and peace between you and God.

If this is what Luther was standing on at the Diet of Worms, how disappointing it was that three short years later there was not peace in Germany because the Bible 

When was the last time you had a day of peace?
