## First reading [Rv 14:6‑7 ESV]

[6] Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people. [7] And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.”

## Epistle [Rm 3:19‑28 ESV; sermon text]

[19] Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. [20] For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

[21] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—[22] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

[27] Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. [28] For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.

[19] Οἴδαμεν δὲ ὅτι ὅσα ὁ νόμος λέγει τοῖς ἐν τῷ νόμῳ λαλεῖ, ἵνα πᾶν στόμα φραγῇ καὶ ὑπόδικος γένηται πᾶς ὁ κόσμος τῷ θεῷ: 
[20] διότι ἐξ ἔργων νόμου οὐ δικαιωθήσεται πᾶσα σὰρξ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, διὰ γὰρ νόμου ἐπίγνωσις ἁμαρτίας. 
[21] Νυνὶ δὲ χωρὶς νόμου δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ πεφανέρωται, μαρτυρουμένη ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν, 
[22] δικαιοσύνη δὲ θεοῦ διὰ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, εἰς πάντας τοὺς πιστεύοντας: οὐ γάρ ἐστιν διαστολή: 
[23] πάντες γὰρ ἥμαρτον καὶ ὑστεροῦνται τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ, 
[24] δικαιούμενοι δωρεὰν τῇ αὐτοῦ χάριτι διὰ τῆς ἀπολυτρώσεως τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ: 
[25] ὃν προέθετο ὁ θεὸς ἱλαστήριον διὰ [τῆς] πίστεως ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ αἵματι εἰς ἔνδειξιν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ διὰ τὴν πάρεσιν τῶν προγεγονότων ἁμαρτημάτων 
[26] ἐν τῇ ἀνοχῇ τοῦ θεοῦ, πρὸς τὴν ἔνδειξιν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ, εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν δίκαιον καὶ δικαιοῦντα τὸν ἐκ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ. 
[27] Ποῦ οὖν ἡ καύχησις; ἐξεκλείσθη. διὰ ποίου νόμου; τῶν ἔργων; οὐχί, ἀλλὰ διὰ νόμου πίστεως. 
[28] λογιζόμεθα γὰρ δικαιοῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς ἔργων νόμου.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 8:31‑36 ESV]

[31] So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, [32] and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” [33] They answered him, “We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, ‘You will become free’?”

[34] Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. [35] The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. [36] So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”

[31] Ἔλεγεν οὖν ὁ Ἰησοῦς πρὸς τοὺς πεπιστευκότας αὐτῷ Ἰουδαίους, Ἐὰν ὑμεῖς μείνητε ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῷ ἐμῷ, ἀληθῶς μαθηταί μού ἐστε, 
[32] καὶ γνώσεσθε τὴν ἀλήθειαν, καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια ἐλευθερώσει ὑμᾶς. 
[33] ἀπεκρίθησαν πρὸς αὐτόν, Σπέρμα Ἀβραάμ ἐσμεν καὶ οὐδενὶ δεδουλεύκαμεν πώποτε: πῶς σὺ λέγεις ὅτι Ἐλεύθεροι γενήσεσθε; 

[34] ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν δοῦλός ἐστιν τῆς ἁμαρτίας. 
[35] ὁ δὲ δοῦλος οὐ μένει ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα: ὁ υἱὸς μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. 
[36] ἐὰν οὖν ὁ υἱὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλευθερώσῃ, ὄντως ἐλεύθεροι ἔσεσθε.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, we fast approaching the day of our Lord's return, and **there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting with fear and foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken** [(Lk&nbsp;21:25&#x2011;26)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2021%3A25-26/).

> **Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.** [(Rv&nbsp;14:6)](http://www.esvbible.org/Revelation%2014%3A6/)

Yes, Satan will be thrown down&mdash;and already has been thrown down&mdash;to make war on Christians.
There are two beasts that will appear&mdash;and may be appearing today&mdash;who worship Satan and prosecute this war against Christians.
Terrible times in the book of Revelation for Christians, and we should be ready&mdash;we should be ready for God's victory.
The victory of the Cross of Jesus *is* the final victory, *and* our Lord Jesus will return to this earth to wipe out all idolatry and evil once and for all and to throw Satan and those who follow him into the lake of fire.
The opportunity for repentance of sin is great, but the time is short.
Lord, help us to repent of our sins daily and to focus on that angel flying directly overhead with an eternal Gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth. And the eternal Gospel is this:

> &ldquo;I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity ... *is my Lord,* who has redeemed me, ... that I may be His own *and live under Him* in everlasting ... This is most certainly true.&rdquo;

Beloved in the Lord, this is the eternal Gospel in a nutshell to which we cling in these last days; this is the eternal Gospel for which Satan afflicts us; this is the eternal Gospel which alone saves us from Satan, sin, death, and hell.

And what would threaten us from being saved by this eternal Gospel are our works.
Satan wants none other than for us to do evil works and then to call them good.
That has always been his game plan.
What we think of our works is serious business with which the devil seeks to topple us to our destruction.

We know exactly what he tried with Job.
*God gave Satan permission to afflict Job.*
The book of Revelation clearly teaches that God continues to give Satan permission to afflict us&mdash;not that He leaves us without help, but that we *cling to His help* and cling to Him alone.
That is faith.
God has blessed Job because Job was a righteous man, but Satan told God,


> **&ldquo;All that a man has he will give for his life. But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.&rdquo; And the LORD said to Satan, &ldquo;Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.&rdquo;** [(Job&nbsp;2:4&#x2011;6 ESV)](http://www.esvbible.org/Job%202%3A4-6/)

Though Job did not suffer perfectly as our Lord Jesus did, he never blamed God for doing wrong and continued to trust in God's promise of Jesus:

> **For I know that my Redeemer lives,**\
> **And He shall stand at last on the earth;**\
> **And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,**\
> **That in my flesh I shall see God,**\
> **Whom I shall see for myself,**\
> **And my eyes shall behold, and not another.**\
> **How my heart yearns within me!** [(Job&nbsp;19:25&#x2011;27 NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+19%3A25-27&version=NKJV)

Job was not suffering for doing evil.
Beloved in the Lord, sometimes our Lord allows us to suffer to test our faith in Jesus, *but we know that He lives!*
What is *excluded* from our faith is the conviction of the heart that we think that we are good people and deserve to go to heaven.
We have the Ten Commandments to thank for that.

> **For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.**

*I know that I am a sinner because I have not kept the Ten Commandments.*

> Are you a father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, or worker? Have you been disobedient, unfaithful, or lazy? ... Have you stolen, been negligent, wasted anything or done any harm?

Yes, I have, and so have you! We stand condemned to die by the Ten Commandments.
I can *never* say I have been good enough for God to take me&mdash;maybe Enoch and Elijah were, but I am not so sure about that&mdash;I can *never* say I have been good enough for God to take me to heaven. I deserve hell! The Ten Commandments give me knowledge of my own sin.

> **But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it&mdash;the righteousness of God _through faith in Jesus Christ_ for all who believe.**

This is the faith of Job, who knew His Redeemer lives.
This is your faith and mine, that Jesus has redeemed me a lost and condemned person, just as He is risen from the dead, lives and reigns to all eternity.
*This faith* is our righteousness&mdash;*this faith* is our righteousness&mdash;*this faith*&mdash;the faith of Job&mdash;means that we stand before God *justified* with no charge of sin against us.
If we stand before God with our good works, He charges us with sin.
If we stand before God with faith in Jesus, He says, &ldquo;Innocent! Holy! My dear child! Look, I have baptized him. Do you see any sin?&rdquo;

This is the eternal Gospel, beloved in the Lord, by which we are saved. This is the eternal Gospel by which we will endure these last days. AMEN.
