## During the service

Prayer for victims and families in Pittsburgh:

> Gracious Father, we come before you with sorrow and anguish over the slaughter of Jews at the hands of a deranged man yesterday in Pittsburgh. We pray for those who died not to have died without faith in Jesus Christ, their Messiah, in their hearts. For we know of Your friendship with their father Abraham, and that to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, and the promises. For those who mourn, bless them by the grace of the Holy Spirit to recount the promise of the Messiah to come from the line of David, and to rejoice that He is Jesus of Nazareth, in whose name they have the forgiveness of sin, and redemption from death and hell. In His name of Jesus Christ the King of the Jews we pray. Amen.

## First reading [Rv 14:6‑7 ESV]

[6] Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people. [7] And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.”

## Epistle [Rm 3:19‑28 ESV; sermon text]

[19] Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. [20] For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

[21] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—[22] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

[27] Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. [28] For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.

[19] Οἴδαμεν δὲ ὅτι ὅσα ὁ νόμος λέγει τοῖς ἐν τῷ νόμῳ λαλεῖ, ἵνα πᾶν στόμα φραγῇ καὶ ὑπόδικος γένηται πᾶς ὁ κόσμος τῷ θεῷ: 
[20] διότι ἐξ ἔργων νόμου οὐ δικαιωθήσεται πᾶσα σὰρξ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, διὰ γὰρ νόμου ἐπίγνωσις ἁμαρτίας. 

[21] Νυνὶ δὲ χωρὶς νόμου δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ πεφανέρωται, μαρτυρουμένη ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν, 
[22] δικαιοσύνη δὲ θεοῦ διὰ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, εἰς πάντας τοὺς πιστεύοντας: οὐ γάρ ἐστιν διαστολή: 
[23] πάντες γὰρ ἥμαρτον καὶ ὑστεροῦνται τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ, 
[24] δικαιούμενοι δωρεὰν τῇ αὐτοῦ χάριτι διὰ τῆς ἀπολυτρώσεως τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ: 
[25] ὃν προέθετο ὁ θεὸς ἱλαστήριον διὰ [τῆς] πίστεως ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ αἵματι εἰς ἔνδειξιν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ διὰ τὴν πάρεσιν τῶν προγεγονότων ἁμαρτημάτων 
[26] ἐν τῇ ἀνοχῇ τοῦ θεοῦ, πρὸς τὴν ἔνδειξιν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ, εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν δίκαιον καὶ δικαιοῦντα τὸν ἐκ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ. 

[27] Ποῦ οὖν ἡ καύχησις; ἐξεκλείσθη. διὰ ποίου νόμου; τῶν ἔργων; οὐχί, ἀλλὰ διὰ νόμου πίστεως. 
[28] λογιζόμεθα γὰρ δικαιοῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς ἔργων νόμου.

## Holy Gospel [Jn 8:31‑36 ESV]

[31] So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, [32] and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” [33] They answered him, “We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, ‘You will become free’?”

[34] Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. [35] The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. [36] So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”

[31] Ἔλεγεν οὖν ὁ Ἰησοῦς πρὸς τοὺς πεπιστευκότας αὐτῷ Ἰουδαίους, Ἐὰν ὑμεῖς μείνητε ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῷ ἐμῷ, ἀληθῶς μαθηταί μού ἐστε, 
[32] καὶ γνώσεσθε τὴν ἀλήθειαν, καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια ἐλευθερώσει ὑμᾶς. 
[33] ἀπεκρίθησαν πρὸς αὐτόν, Σπέρμα Ἀβραάμ ἐσμεν καὶ οὐδενὶ δεδουλεύκαμεν πώποτε: πῶς σὺ λέγεις ὅτι Ἐλεύθεροι γενήσεσθε; 

[34] ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν δοῦλός ἐστιν τῆς ἁμαρτίας. 
[35] ὁ δὲ δοῦλος οὐ μένει ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα: ὁ υἱὸς μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. 
[36] ἐὰν οὖν ὁ υἱὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλευθερώσῃ, ὄντως ἐλεύθεροι ἔσεσθε.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, 
there are sayings in the Bible that many proclaim but may not understand.
For example, **"God is love,"** [1 John 4:8](https://www.esv.org/1+John+4:8/).
**God is love**, but what about the God who put to death the man who picked up sticks on the Sabbath ([Nm 15:32‑36](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+15:32/))?
We heard what happened to him last week: God had him put to death for picking up sticks on the Sabbath.
**God is love** but He despises sin---if there is sin going on, he *will* take action---decisive action.
He warns us not to sin and especially not to be the cause of anyone's temptation to sin:

> **“Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”** ([Lk 17:1‑4](https://www.esv.org/Luke+17/) ESV)

Yes, as you heard, forgiveness is the final word from the God of love.
But whether through the words of the Bible or from the lips of a preacher or from the lips of any Christian He calls us to repentance: "Despise your sin like I do and stop doing it---**'Go and sin no more'**" ([Jn 8:11](https://www.esv.org/John+8:11/)).
You cannot say, "**God is love**," and say nothing about God despising sin.

In our Holy Gospel today, we have this Word of Christ: **"The truth will set you free"** ([Jn 8:32](https://www.esv.org/John+8:32/)).
A drug dealer could say, **"The truth will set you free"** as in "You will experience the truth when you take these drugs, so buy these drugs for the experience."
And, tragically, many do.
Pontius Pilate asked a good question on Good Friday: 
**“What is truth?”** ([Jn 18:38](https://www.esv.org/John+18:38/))
You may get as many answers for *What is truth?* as you would for *What is love?*.
Yet if you would listen to God---if you would listen the Bible---you would know what love is, and if you would listen to the Bible, you would know what truth is as well.

The truth is that we all understand what is good and what is evil.
The tragic news out of Pittsburgh is evil.
A blood donor does good.
The Bible clearly teaches that we are born with consciences which know the difference between good and evil, right and wrong ([Rm 2:14‑15](https://www.esv.org/Romans+2:14/)).
Killing is evil; healing is good.
Stealing is evil; giving is good.
We all believe this about God, too: God rewards good and punishes evil.
(I do recall ever meeting anyone who believed there is no God and He does not reward of good and punish of evil.)

But here it gets tricky and the devil is ready with his tricks.
Here our flesh is aroused and leads us down the wrong path.
We are tempted to follow a truth that is no truth at all.
We may follow a lie that can never set us free but only lead us to the chains of hell.
What is this deception?
That we can boast before God in a law of works: "I have done well and God must show me His favor."

For God has been to kind to document what is good and what is evil.

1. **You shall have no other gods.**
1. **You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.**
1. **Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.**
1. **Honor your father and your mother.**
1. **You shall not murder.**
1. **You shall not commit adultery.**
1. **You shall not steal.**
1. **You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.**
1. **You shall not covet your neighbor's house.**
1. **You shall not covet your neighbors's wife, or his manservant or his maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.** (It is his; God gave it to him; you cannot have it.)

After having heard God's *Yes* and God's *No*, which of us can stand before Christ at the Judgment on the last day and say, "I have done well and God must show me His favor"?
Our Epistle reading from Romans, chapter 3 clearly proclaims, **"By the works of the law _no human being will be justified in his sight_, since through the law comes knowledge of sin."**
The main thing I know from the Ten Commandments is that I have broken them multiple times.
It is the truth.

In the Bible, you may recall, there was the rich man who sincerely believed he had kept God's Law.

> **As [Jesus] was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’” And he said to him, _“Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.”_ And Jesus, looking at him, _loved him_, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.** ([Mk 10:17‑22](https://www.esv.org/Mark+10:17/) ESV)

As sincere as the rich man might have been, thinking he had kept God's Law, Jesus loved him by pointing out that he loved money more than obeying God.
The rich man, as upstanding as he was, was a straight-up idolater condemned by the First Commandment: **You shall have no other gods.**
On a side note, if you have been drawn into buying lottery tickets because the jackpots have been huge, beware of the rich man's problem.

> **"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money."** ([Mt 6:24](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6:24/) ESV)

The truth is **"by the works of the law _no human being will be justified in his sight_, since through the law comes knowledge of sin."**
The truth is that if we have bought in to "I have done well and God must show me His favor" we have no hope before God.
If this comes as a surprise to you, it is about time you heard the truth.

But do not despair, for there is more to the truth: *Jesus is the truth.*
The person of Jesus Christ is the truth.
He is God, begotten of the Father from eternity.
He is man, born of the virgin Mary.
He has redeemeed you from sin, death, and the devil.
*Redeem* means He has gotten you out of the biggest trouble imaginable---the trouble that you brought on yourself by your own sins.
*[Point to the Crucifixion window]* Whatever debt you had to God for breaking the Ten Commandments Jesus paid, not with gold or silver, but with His holy, precious blood and His innocent sufferning and death.
The truth is *redemption*; the truth is *propitiation*.
*Redemption* means that Jesus got you out of the trouble for your sins---you gave Him your death *[Point to the altar]* and He gives you His life; your sins are paid for by His holy, precious blood.
*Propitiation* means that God's anger was spent on His own Son Jesus as He hung on the Cross, crying out, **"My God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?"**
For you who receive from the Holy Spirit that precious gift of faith in Jesus as *your Savior from sin*, God's anger turns to your favor just as Jesus' death turns to your life.

This is the **law of faith** of which St. Paul speaks in Romans, chapter 3.
It is true: **"One is justified by faith apart from works of the law."**
If God's favor is what you want, now you have it: believe in Christ, and you have God's favor.
Believe in Christ and He will smile on you.
Boast in what Christ has done for you, and despair of what you had hoped your good works would do for you.
For our righteous acts are as filthy rags before God ([Is 64:6](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-Chapter-64/)), but our faith in His Son and in His Baptism wash us white as snow ([Is 1:18](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+1:18/)).
This is the truth that sets you free.

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
