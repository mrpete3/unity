## First reading [Dt 8:1‑10 ESV]

[1] “The whole commandment that I command you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers. [2] And you shall remember the whole way that the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. [3] And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. [4] Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years. [5] Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, the LORD your God disciplines you. [6] So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him. [7] For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in the valleys and hills, [8] a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey, [9] a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. [10] And you shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.”

[1]  ΠΑΣΑΣ τὰς ἐντολάς, ἃς ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον, φυλάξεσθε ποιεῖν, ἵνα ζῆτε καὶ πολυπλασιασθῆτε καὶ εἰσέλθητε καὶ κληρονομήσητε τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν. 
[2]  καὶ μνησθήσῃ πᾶσαν τὴν ὁδόν, ἣν ἤγαγέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ὅπως ἂν κακώσῃ σε καὶ πειράσῃ σε καὶ διαγνωσθῇ τὰ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, εἰ φυλάξῃ τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ ἢ οὔ. 
[3]  καὶ ἐκάκωσέ σε καὶ ἐλιμαγχόνησέ σε καὶ ἐψώμισέ σε τὸ μάννα, ὃ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν οἱ πατέρες σου, ἵνα ἀναγγείλῃ σοι, ὅτι οὐκ ἐπ᾿ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἀλλ᾿ ἐπὶ παντὶ ρήματι τῷ ἐκπορευομένῳ διὰ στόματος Θεοῦ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος. 
[4]  τὰ ἱμάτιά σου οὐκ ἐπαλαιώθη ἀπὸ σοῦ, τὰ ὑποδήματά σου οὐ κατετρίβη ἀπὸ σοῦ, οἱ πόδες σου οὐκ ἐτυλώθησαν, ἰδοὺ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη. 
[5]  καὶ γνώσῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ὅτι ὡς εἴ τις ἄνθρωπος παιδεύσῃ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, οὕτω Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου παιδεύσει σε, 
[6]  καὶ φυλάξῃ τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου πορεύεσθαι ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτόν· 
[7]  ὁ γὰρ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰσάξει σε εἰς γῆν ἀγαθὴν καὶ πολλήν, οὗ χείμαρροι ὑδάτων καὶ πηγαὶ ἀβύσσων ἐκπορευόμεναι διὰ τῶν πεδίων καὶ διὰ τῶν ὀρέων· 
[8]  γῆ πυροῦ καὶ κριθῆς, ἄμπελοι, συκαῖ, ροαί, γῆ ἐλαίας ἐλαίου καὶ μέλιτος· 
[9]  γῆ, ἐφ᾿ ἧς οὐ μετὰ πτωχείας φαγῇ τὸν ἄρτον σου καὶ οὐκ ἐνδεηθήσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς οὐδέν· γῆ, ἧς οἱ λίθοι σίδηρος, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὀρέων αὐτῆς μεταλλεύσεις χαλκόν· 
[10]  καὶ φαγῇ καὶ ἐμπλησθήσῃ καὶ εὐλογήσεις Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τῆς ἀγαθῆς, ἧς δέδωκέ σοι.

## Epistle [1Tm 2:1‑4 ESV; sermon text]

[1] First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, [2] for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. [3] This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, [4] who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

[1] Παρακαλῶ οὖν πρῶτον πάντων ποιεῖσθαι δεήσεις, προσευχάς, ἐντεύξεις, εὐχαριστίας, ὑπὲρ πάντων ἀνθρώπων, [2] ὑπὲρ βασιλέων καὶ πάντων τῶν ἐν ὑπεροχῇ ὄντων, ἵνα ἤρεμον καὶ ἡσύχιον βίον διάγωμεν ἐν πάσῃ εὐσεβείᾳ καὶ σεμνότητι. [3] τοῦτο καλὸν καὶ ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν θεοῦ, [4] ὃς πάντας ἀνθρώπους θέλει σωθῆναι καὶ εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας ἐλθεῖν.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 17:11‑19 ESV]

[11] On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.
[12] And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance [13] and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” [14] When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed. [15] Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; [16] and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. [17] Then Jesus answered, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? [18] Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?”
[19] And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.”

[11] Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ αὐτὸς διήρχετο διὰ μέσον Σαμαρείας καὶ Γαλιλαίας. 
[12] καὶ εἰσερχομένου αὐτοῦ εἴς τινα κώμην ἀπήντησαν [αὐτῷ] δέκα λεπροὶ ἄνδρες, οἳ ἔστησαν πόρρωθεν, 
[13] καὶ αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνὴν λέγοντες, Ἰησοῦ ἐπιστάτα, ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς. 
[14] καὶ ἰδὼν εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Πορευθέντες ἐπιδείξατε ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν. καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ὑπάγειν αὐτοὺς ἐκαθαρίσθησαν. 
[15] εἷς δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν, ἰδὼν ὅτι ἰάθη, ὑπέστρεψεν μετὰ φωνῆς μεγάλης δοξάζων τὸν θεόν, 
[16] καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον παρὰ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ εὐχαριστῶν αὐτῷ: καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν Σαμαρίτης. 
[17] ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν, Οὐχὶ οἱ δέκα ἐκαθαρίσθησαν; οἱ δὲ ἐννέα ποῦ; 
[18] οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες δοῦναι δόξαν τῷ θεῷ εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος; 
[19] καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Ἀναστὰς πορεύου: ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
On this Thanksgiving Eve, we can look at the cornucopia---the horn of plenty---and be reminded of what we are thankful for when we pray, **"Give us this day our daily bread."**
We are thankful to our Father in heaven for all the support and needs of the body, such as food, drink, clothing, shoes, house, home, land, animals, money, goods, a devout husband or wife, devout children, devout workers, devout and faithful rulers, good government, good weather, peace, health, self-control, good reputation, good friends, faithful neighbors, and the like.
I am particularly grateful for my own devout wife and devout children, one of whom is here tonight with *his own* devout wife, thanks be to God!
I am also grateful for my devout parents who are in their eighties.
I have had my parents every day of my life. God be praised!

But I have learned from you---from my congregation---that this will not always be so.
When I came to Unity, Rudy and Dorothy attended Bible study as did Ray and Frieda.
Verna was here and, of course, Paula.
Last year, on this very night, on Thanksgiving Eve, was the last time I heard Paula's voice.
She missed the Thanksgiving Eve service and I called her afterward to ask if she was okay.
She thanked me for calling and said that, no, she felt wiped out.
Thank God for Paula, but the Lord took her.
Thank God for Verna, for Ray and Frieda, for Rudy and Dorothy, but the Lord took them, too.
Many of the things for which we are grateful we will not always have, and the Holy Spirit bless us with thankfulness for the ones we have while we still have them.
I thank God for every one of you.

We have much to be thankful for, but do we know how to be thankful and how to show it?
Our Holy Gospel today is the same every year: the ten lepers of Luke, chapter 17:

> **On the way to Jerusalem [Jesus] was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus answered, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.”** ([Lk 17:11‑19](https://www.esv.org/Luke+17:11/) ESV)

**"Go and show yourselves to the priests"** is all Jesus had to say for the ten lepers to be cleansed, along with the lepers' faith to listen to Jesus and trust His Word.
That was it: the Word of Christ and faith.
The result of that faith was healing from leprosy, and let us not be the ones to be healed by Jesus and not return to thank Him. *Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Jesus, for my family, thank You my congregation, thank You for my health, and first and foremost thank You for the living waters of the Holy Spirit who assures me that it is true---my sins are washed away in Your name!*

Returning to the ten lepers, let us not brush that off and say, "People don't have leprosy these days."
Maybe not---not at least among the people you know---but *thank God you do not*.
Thank You, heavenly Father, for Your healing hand through all that science and medicine have brought to our daily lives.
And if you are occupied in the health professions, Jesus bless you as you are His healing hand for many needy people.
It is a blessing from God that leprosy is rare.
Thank God that smallpox is rare.
Thank God that neither I nor anyone I know is stricken with polio.

But modern medicine only goes so far, and not as far as *the Word of Christ*.
The Word of Christ, beloved in the Lord, we have the Word of Christ!
And it is for that Word---the Word of God made flesh and the revealed Word of God in the Bible that we hear and believe---that I am most thankful.
How about this Word of Christ: **"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven"** ([Mt 5:3](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5:3/) ESV)?
Or this Word of Christ: **"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more"** ([Jn 8:11](https://www.esv.org/John+8:11/) ESV)?
Or this Word of Christ: **"Lazarus, come out!"** ([Jn 11:43](https://www.esv.org/John+11:43/) ESV)?
Or this Word of Christ spoken from the Cross: **"It is finished"** ([Jn 19:30](https://www.esv.org/John+19:30/) ESV)?
Or this Word of Christ: **"Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved"** ([Mk 16:16a](https://www.esv.org/Mark+16:16/) ESV)?
Or this Word of Christ: **"Behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age"** ([Mt 28:20](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+28:20/) ESV)?

Yes, this---the Word of Christ, the Word of God---is primarily what we are thankful for, for the forgiveness of our sins unto life eternal throught Jesus Christ, our Lord.
**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
