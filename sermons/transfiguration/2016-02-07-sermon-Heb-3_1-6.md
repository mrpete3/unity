## Old Testament [Dt 34:1‑12 ESV]

[1] Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan, [2] all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, [3] the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the Valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. [4] And the LORD said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.” [5] So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD, [6] and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but no one knows the place of his burial to this day. [7] Moses was 120 years old when he died. His eye was undimmed, and his vigor unabated. [8] And the people of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

[9] And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. So the people of Israel obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses. [10] And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, [11] none like him for all the signs and the wonders that the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land, [12] and for all the mighty power and all the great deeds of terror that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.

## Epistle [Heb 3:1‑6 ESV; sermon text]

[1] Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, [2] who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house. [3] For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses—as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. [4] (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) [5] Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, [6] but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.

## Holy Gospel [Lk 9:28‑36 ESV]

[28] Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. [29] And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white. [30] And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah, [31] who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. [32] Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. [33] And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said. [34] As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. [35] And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!” [36] And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.

## Introit [Ps 84:1‑2, 9, 11; antiphon: Ps 84:4]

> Blessèd are those who dwell | in your house,*  
> ever sing- | ing your praise!  
> How lovely is your | dwelling place,*  
> O | LORD of hosts!  
> My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts | of the LORD;*  
> my heart and flesh sing for joy to the | living God.
> Behold our shield, | O God;*  
> look on the face of your a- | nointed!  
> For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and | honor.*  
> No good thing does he withhold from those who walk up- | rightly.
	
## Collect

O God, in the glorious transfiguration of Your beloved Son You confirmed the mysteries of the faith by the testimony of Moses and Elijah. In the voice that came from the bright cloud You wonderfully foreshadowed our adoption by grace. Mercifully make us co‑heirs with the King in His glory and bring us to the fullness of our inheritance in heaven; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, I do not know if you caught that in the Old Testament reading, but **Moses was 120 years old when he died. His eye was undimmed, and his vigor unabated** [(Dt 34:7)](http://www.esvbible.org/Deuteronomy%2034%3A7/). It is common for our bodies to grow weak and then we die, but not so for Moses. I imagine he literally dropped dead, but in excellent health up to that moment.

But I admire our older members for your vigor. You regularly come to church, maintain the church, take on projects, and—God forbid but I know this has happened—climb ladders. I want to be like you other than I think I should not climb ladders when I am old. What makes me happy about all this is that you look better than you should. “You don't look a day over 70.” But you're in your 80's or even over 90! Thanks be to God for your good health and vigor. You are full of surprises! We may have an I-want-to-be-like-Moses club here at Unity, but I would be really surprised if you glowed like Jesus did when He was transfigured.

> **And as [Jesus] was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white. And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah.** [(Lk 9:29‑30)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%209%3A29-30/)

You all have beautiful faces that I am happy to see at all times.

I have observed our members' faces after their final hour, and every once in a while I see the final disposition of the face to be what causes some people to say, “Look, he looks so peaceful.” Sometimes it happens, sometimes not, but I think of it as a hint of the transfiguration from mortal man to immortal man. I have never experienced it, but I hope to by faith in Jesus. We know that Moses and Elijah experienced it, for they are on the mountain together with Jesus. Moses never lost his strength, but nevertheless he died. Elijah, the Bible tells us, never died at all [(2Ki 2:1‑12)](http://www.esvbible.org/2%20Kings%202%3A1-12/), but he was born mortal and somehow his mortal body was transformed to an immortal body without experiencing death at all. Christ's Transfiguration shows not only who He is, but who we will be with Him, together with Moses and Elijah.

If I should be with you in your final hour, I will not be surprised if you glow—if you face shows a trace of who you are with: Jesus in heaven.

AMEN.

## Outline

<center>WE GLOW WHEN GOD SPEAKS TO US.</center>

1. Moses' face glowed when he spoke with God.
1. Jesus glowed on the Mount of Transfiguration.
    1. More glory than Moses (Heb 3:3)
    1. Jesus is the builder, Moses is the house.
    1. Jesus is the builder, you are the house.
1. In our final hour, our faces may glow for that very reason—that we speak with God.
    1. Put our hope in it.
    1. Might as well boast about it.
    
## Notes

Dt 34:4. Moses sees the Promised Land but is not allowed to enter it.

Dt 34:7. Moses dies without having lost his physical strength or eyesight.

Dt 34:9. I forgot that Moses literally laid his hands on Joshua.

Dt 34:10. The LORD knew Moses face-to-face. Moses' face glowed when he spoke with Him [(Ex 34:29‑35)](http://www.esvbible.org/Exodus%2034%3A29-35/).

The Transfiguration implies that Jesus is God.
