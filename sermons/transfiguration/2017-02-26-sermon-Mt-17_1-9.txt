## Old Testament [Ex 24:8‑18 ESV]

[8] And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”

[9] Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, [10] and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. [11] And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.

[12] The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and wait there, that I may give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.” [13] So Moses rose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God. [14] And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever has a dispute, let him go to them.”

[15] Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. [16] The glory of the LORD dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. [17] Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel.
[18] Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

## Epistle [2Pe 1:16‑21 ESV]

[16] For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[17] For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,” [18] we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. [19] And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, [20] knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. [21] For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

## Holy Gospel [Mt 17:1‑9 ESV; sermon text]

[1] And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. [2] And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. [3] And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. [4] And Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
[5] He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.”
[6] When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. [7] But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Rise, and have no fear.” [8] And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.

[9] And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”

[1] Καὶ μεθ' ἡμέρας ἓξ παραλαμβάνει ὁ Ἰησοῦς τὸν Πέτρον καὶ Ἰάκωβον καὶ Ἰωάννην τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναφέρει αὐτοὺς εἰς ὄρος ὑψηλὸν κατ' ἰδίαν. 
[2] καὶ μετεμορφώθη ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔλαμψεν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ὡς ὁ ἥλιος, τὰ δὲ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο λευκὰ ὡς τὸ φῶς. 
[3] καὶ ἰδοὺ ὤφθη αὐτοῖς Μωϋσῆς καὶ Ἠλίας συλλαλοῦντες μετ' αὐτοῦ. 
[4] ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν τῷ Ἰησοῦ, Κύριε, καλόν ἐστιν ἡμᾶς ὧδε εἶναι: εἰ θέλεις, ποιήσω ὧδε τρεῖς σκηνάς, σοὶ μίαν καὶ Μωϋσεῖ μίαν καὶ Ἠλίᾳ μίαν. 
[5] ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος ἰδοὺ νεφέλη φωτεινὴ ἐπεσκίασεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἰδοὺ φωνὴ ἐκ τῆς νεφέλης λέγουσα, Οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός, ἐν ᾧ εὐδόκησα: ἀκούετε αὐτοῦ. 
[6] καὶ ἀκούσαντες οἱ μαθηταὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα. 
[7] καὶ προσῆλθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἁψάμενος αὐτῶν εἶπεν, Ἐγέρθητε καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθε. 
[8] ἐπάραντες δὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν οὐδένα εἶδον εἰ μὴ αὐτὸν Ἰησοῦν μόνον. 

[9] Καὶ καταβαινόντων αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς λέγων, Μηδενὶ εἴπητε τὸ ὅραμα ἕως οὗ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐγερθῇ.

## Collect

O God, in the glorious transfiguration of Your beloved Son You confirmed the mysteries of the faith by the testimony of Moses and Elijah. In the voice that came from the bright cloud You wonderfully foreshowed our adoption by grace. Mercifully make us co-heirs with the King in His glory and bring us to the fullness of our inheritance in heaven; through the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon[^1]

[^1]: I took some ideas from a sermon I preached on February 8, 2008.

Beloved in the Lord, our Lord Jesus, after His Resurrection, walked the earth for 40 days in His new body (Ac 1:3).
And during that time, you may remember, Jesus met Cleopas and another disciple on the road to Emmaus and told them, **"Everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled"** [(Lk 24:44 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Luke+24/).
Notice He said, **"Moses and the Prophets _and the Psalms_."**
Let us look at a psalm that is about Jesus: Psalm 2.

> **You are my Son; today I have begotten you. ...**\
> **Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,**\
> **for his wrath is quickly kindled.**\
> **Blessed are all who take refuge in him.**

The prophets speak about Jesus---Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Amos, Isaiah, Elisha, and Elijah speak about Jesus.
And then there is Moses---the leader of Israel in the wilderness and also a prophet---the prophet who on that fearsome day went up on Mt Sinai into the fire to receive God's holy Ten Commanments.

When we read the books that Moses wrote---the first five books of the Bible---when we read about the prophets and the Psalms, we can find many words about Jesus.
But you know the saying, "A picture's worth a thousand words."
You could even say, "If a picture’s worth a thousand words, then being there is worth a million."
Let me give you an example.
*[Illustration]* I thank all of you who prayed for Joyce during the last few weeks.
I called Joan, and Joan got the prayer chain going.
I told others privately, also, that Joyce was in need of prayer.
Thank you for praying for Joyce!
The Father heard your prayers, and Jesus did a good job!
I will briefly describe with words, as I am able, what happened with your prayers.
Her body was failing and her doctor told me there was nothing more he could do.
I can tell you that last Sunday, I took the youth along to see her at the Lutheran Home---they waited while I went to Joyce's room.
She was stirring a little but did not have the strength to suck water from a straw.
I can tell you that I last saw her three days ago on Thursday.
I walked in the room, expecting to see Joyce close to her final hour.
But---thanks be to God!---her eyes were wide open, she grabbed my arm, and asked me, "What happened?"
She ate her dinner and even tried to hold her own cup and drink from it.
And---to prove that Joyce is doing *much* better---thanks be to God!---she was telling me what to do.
I was so happy, but that hardly describes it.
I felt happy and and amazed, but even my emotions can hardly describe what it was like to be with Joyce.
I can say I was in awe of Christ's care for us when there seems to be no help.
I praise the name of Jesus, who helps all who trust in Him in every trouble.
But even those words are nothing like being there.

Peter, James, and John were there.
They were chosen by Jesus to witness His Transfiguration,
and they were there.
That experience must have been worth a million words, and even a million words are not enough.
However, our Epistle reading gives us just a few words from Peter---what he had to say about having been an eyewitness of Christ's Transfiguration.

> **For when [our Lord Jesus Christ] received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,” we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.** [(2Pe 1:17‑21 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/2+Peter+1/)

In a nutshell, here is what Peter says:
"I was there, but let me tell you about the Bible."
Peter was there!
He saw Jesus glow and he heard the Father's voice from heaven,
**"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."**
**"Listen to Him,"** says the Father.
**"Listen to the prophets,"** says the apostle Peter.
And did not Jesus tell Cleopas and the other disciple, **"Everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled"**?
You may wish you were up on the mountain with Peter, James, and John.
Yet Peter, who was there, would direct you to your Bible.
Jesus is there, in your Bible.
The Holy Spirit, through the Word revealed in the Bible *brings you Jesus* and puts you up on the mount of Transfiguration with Him.
You will be there.
No one will need to explain to you what it is like to be with Jesus on the mountain---you will know from personal experience more than words can explain.
The Holy Spirit first convicts you of your sin.
If you do not believe in Jesus, the Spirit tells you might be afraid of the punishment your sins deserve (Jn 16:9).
He then shows you your Savior, your Lord Jesus who came to serve you by suffering the punishment of your sins on His Cross.
You are forgiven by His name. Jesus has done it; He is yours; so says the Bible.
Take up your own cross and follow Him with joy, for you have been with Him on the mountain.
AMEN.
