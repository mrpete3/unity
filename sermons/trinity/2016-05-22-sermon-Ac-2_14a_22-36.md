## Old Testament [Pr 8:1-4, 22‑31 ESV]

> [1] Does not wisdom call?  
> Does not understanding raise her voice?  
> [2] On the heights beside the way,  
> at the crossroads she takes her stand;  
> [3] beside the gates in front of the town,  
> at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:  
> [4] “To you, O men, I call,  
> and my cry is to the children of man.
	
> [22] “The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work,  
> the first of his acts of old.  
> [23] Ages ago I was set up,  
> at the first, before the beginning of the earth.  
> [24] When there were no depths I was brought forth,  
> when there were no springs abounding with water.  
> [25] Before the mountains had been shaped,  
> before the hills, I was brought forth,  
> [26] before he had made the earth with its fields,  
> or the first of the dust of the world.  
> [27] When he established the heavens, I was there;  
> when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,  
> [28] when he made firm the skies above,  
> when he established the fountains of the deep,  
> [29] when he assigned to the sea its limit,  
> so that the waters might not transgress his command,  
> when he marked out the foundations of the earth,  
> [30] then I was beside him, like a master workman,  
> and I was daily his delight,  
> rejoicing before him always,  
> [31] rejoicing in his inhabited world  
> and delighting in the children of man.
	
## Epistle [Ac 2:14a, 22-36 ESV; sermon text]

[14] But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them:

[22] “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—[23] this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. [24] God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. [25] For David says concerning him,

> “‘I saw the Lord always before me,  
> for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;  
> [26] therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;  
> my flesh also will dwell in hope.  
> [27] For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,  
> or let your Holy One see corruption.  
> [28] You have made known to me the paths of life;  
> you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’

[29] “Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. [30] Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, [31] he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. [32] This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. [33] Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. [34] For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,

> “‘The Lord said to my Lord,  
> “Sit at my right hand,  
> [35] 	until I make your enemies your footstool.”’

[36] Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”

## Holy Gospel [Jn 8:48-59 ESV]

[48] The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” [49] Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. [50] Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. [51] Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.” [52] The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.’ [53] Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?” [54] Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ [55] But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. [56] Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.” [57] So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?” [58] Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” [59] So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.

## Introit [Ps 16:8-11; antiphon: Liturgical Text]

> Blessed be the Holy Trinity and the undivided | Unity.*  
> Let us give glory to him because he has shown his mer- | cy to us. 
> I have set the LORD always be- | fore me;*
> because he is at my right hand, I shall not be | shaken.
> Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being re- | joices;*
> my flesh also | dwells secure.
> For you will not abandon my soul | to Sheol,*
> or let your holy one see cor- | ruption.
> You make known to me the | path of life;*
> in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures for- | evermore.


## Collect

Almighty and everlasting God,
You have given us grace
to acknowledge the glory of the eternal Trinity
by the confession of a true faith
and to worship the Unity in the power of the Divine Majesty.
Keep us steadfast in this faith
and defend us from all adversities;
for You, O Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, live and reign,
one God, now and forever.
