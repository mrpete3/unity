## Old Testament [Gn 1:1‑2:4a ESV]

[1] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. [2] The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

[3] And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. [4] And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. [5] God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

[6] And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” [7] And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. [8] And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.

[9] And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. [10] God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.

[11] And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so. [12] The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. [13] And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.

[14] And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, [15] and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. [16] And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars. [17] And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, [18] to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. [19] And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.

[20] And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.” [21] So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. [22] And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” [23] And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.

[24] And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. [25] And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

[26] Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”

> [27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
	
[28] And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” [29] And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. [30] And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. [31] And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

[1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. [2] And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. [3] So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.

[4] These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.

## Epistle [Ac 2:14a, 22‑36 ESV]

[14a] But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them:

[22] “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—[23] this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. [24] God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. [25] For David says concerning him,

> “‘I saw the Lord always before me,\
> for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;\
> [26] therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;\
> my flesh also will dwell in hope.\
> [27] For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,\
> or let your Holy One see corruption.\
> [28] You have made known to me the paths of life;\
> you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’

[29] “Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. [30] Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, [31] he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. [32] This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. [33] Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. [34] For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,

> “‘The Lord said to my Lord,\
> “Sit at my right hand,\
> [35] 	until I make your enemies your footstool.”’

[36] Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”

## Holy Gospel [Mt 28:16‑20 ESV; sermon text]

[16] Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. [17] And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. [18] And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. [19] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20] teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

------------

[16] Οἱ δὲ ἕνδεκα μαθηταὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν εἰς τὸ ὄρος οὗ ἐτάξατο αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, 
[17] καὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν προσεκύνησαν, οἱ δὲ ἐδίστασαν. 
[18] καὶ προσελθὼν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς λέγων, Ἐδόθη μοι πᾶσα ἐξουσία ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ [τῆς] γῆς. 
[19] πορευθέντες οὖν μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, βαπτίζοντες αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος, 
[20] διδάσκοντες αὐτοὺς τηρεῖν πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν: καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ μεθ' ὑμῶν εἰμι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἕως τῆς συντελείας τοῦ αἰῶνος.

## Introit [Ps 16:8-11; antiphon: Litugical Text]

> Blessed be the Holy Trinity and the undivided | Unity.\*\
> Let us give glory to him because he has shown his mer- | cy to us.\
> I have set the LORD always be- | fore me;\*\
> because he is at my right hand, I shall not be | shaken.\
> Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being re- | joices;\*\
> my flesh also | dwells secure.\
> For you will not abandon my soul | to Sheol,\*\
> or let your holy one see cor- | ruption.\
> You make known to me the | path of life;\*\
> in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures for- | evermore.\

## Athanasian Creed

> Whoever desires to be saved must, above all, hold the catholic faith.\
> Whoever does not keep it whole and undefiled will without doubt perish eternally.\
> And the catholic faith is this, that we worship one God in trinity and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the persons nor dividing the substance.\
> For the Father is one person, the Son is another, and the Holy Spirit is another.\
> But the Godhead of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is one: the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.\
> Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit:\
> the Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, the Holy Spirit uncreated;\
> the Father infinite, the Son infinite, the Holy Spirit infinite;\
> the Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal.\
> And yet there are not three Eternals, but one Eternal, just as there are not three Uncreated or three Infinites, but one Uncreated and one Infinite.\
> In the same way, the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, the Holy Spirit almighty;\
> and yet there are not three Almighties but one Almighty.\
> So the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God;\
> and yet there are not three Gods, but one God.\
> So the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, the Holy Spirit is Lord;\
> and yet there are not three Lords, but one Lord.\
> Just as we are compelled by the Christian truth to acknowledge each distinct person as God and Lord,\
> so also are we prohibited by the catholic religion to say that there are three Gods or Lords.\
> The Father is not made nor created nor begotten by anyone.\
> The Son is neither made nor created, but begotten of the Father alone.\
> The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son, neither made nor created nor begotten but proceeding.\
> Thus, there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.\
> And in this Trinity none is before or after another; none is greater or less than another;\
> but the whole three persons are coeternal with each other and coequal so that in all things, as has been stated above, the Trinity in Unity and Unity in Trinity is to be worshiped.\
> Therefore, whoever desires to be saved must think thus about the Trinity.

> But it is also necessary for everlasting salvation that one faithfully believe the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.\
> Therefore, it is the right faith that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is at the same time both God and man.\
> He is God, begotten from the substance of the Father before all ages; and He is man, born of the substance of His mother in this age:\
> perfect God and perfect man, composed of a rational soul and human flesh;\
> equal to the Father with respect to His divinity, less than the Father with respect to His humanity.\
> Although He is God and man, He is not two, but one Christ:\
> one, however, not by the conversion of the divinity into flesh but by the assumption of the humanity into God;\
> one altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.\
> For as the rational soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ,\
> who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again on the third day from the dead,\
> ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father, from whence He will come to judge the living and the dead.\
> At His coming all people will rise again with their bodies and give an account concerning their own deeds.\
> And those who have done good will enter into eternal life, and those who have done evil into eternal fire.\
> This is the catholic faith; whoever does not believe it faithfully and firmly cannot be saved.

## Collect

Almighty and everlasting God, You have given us grace to acknowledge the glory of the eternal Trinity by the confession of a true faith and to worship the Unity in the power of the Divine Majesty. Keep us steadfast in this faith and defend us from all adversities; for You, O Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, live and reign, one God, now and forever.

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, I am happy to report that more and more people seem to believe in God and even though we are educated in the public schools not to talk about God, even our young people believe in God and are happy to talk about Him; we are blessed to have them in our church.
What a wonderful thing it is that most people, for example---many of whom who have little or no experience reading a Bible---know very well that **God is love**, and that *is* in the Bible: **God is love** [(1Jn 4:8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/1+John+4/).
But what is love?

> **For God so _loved_ the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.** [(Jn 3:16 KJV)](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-3/)

And we have, in the last two weeks, certainly had good discussion in adult Bible study about *what is love?*.
There is no question that **God is love**, but today we celebrate that *God is Trinity*, and where to you find *that* in the Bible?
The answer is *nowhere*: nowhere in the Bible do you find the word *Trinity*.
So, we better have a darn good reason to use it in church as much as we do, and especially as we use it so often in the Athanasian Creed to confess our faith in God.

Let us stick to the Bible---let God tell us with His own words who He is and let us keep our own invented words, like *Trinity*, out of it for the time being.

> **In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.**

> **And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.** [(Gn 1:1‑5 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1/)

God, the Bible tells us, is the Creator of all things.
And in that sense, the whole *world* is a Bible because you can you not read the world and wonder, "Who made this? Who made the sun and the earth and everything that lives on earth? This is amazing!"
Our reason---our common sense---cries out, "Someone made all of this!" because of the beauty and complexity of, for examples, the flowers that bloom at this time of year and the bees work together to visit the flowers, take out the nectar, and make honey out of it.
It is more beautiful, more vast, more efficient than anything man has invented; therefore, someone greater than man---God---invented it and made it.

The Bible tells us *how* we made it in case we were curious because we were not there to watch Him make it.
The Bible tells us that He *spoke*: **And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.**

But did you catch what else happened at creation? **The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.**
Could this be the same Spirit who was poured out on us at Pentecost?
Let us look at what the Bible has to say about the Spirit of God.
Psalm 139:7‑8 declares,

> **Where shall I go from your Spirit?**\
> **Or where shall I flee from your presence?**\
> **If I ascend to heaven, you are there!**\
> **If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!** [(Ps 139:7‑8 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+139/)

The Spirit of God is everywhere at all times, which is something we believe to be true about God.
Therefore the Spirit of God *is* God, for his is with me at all times and in all places.

We have a serious example in Acts, chapter 5.
Ananias and Sapphira were deceitful about money.
The apostle Peter perceived this and said, **"Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? ... Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God"** [(Ac 5:3‑4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+5/).
The apostle Peter does not hesitate to call the Holy Spirit God.

There is no doubt that Jesus is God.
Just turn to the first verses of John:

> **In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.** [(Jn 1:1‑3 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+1/)

This is intended to sound like the first verses of the Bible.
When God speaks at creation, his Word is not just sounds out of His mouth: **His Word is His only-begotten Son Jesus.**
And at this point, God is not like his creatures at all.
We kind of understand the power of words.
If someone with authority says something, like the President of the United States says,
"Send the Marines to Iraq," it happens.
At creation, the Word of the Father is His Son, who makes everything we see: **All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.**
We know that this Word of God is Jesus because the apostle John soon says, **"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth"** [(Jn 1:14 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+1/).
That is, Jesus is Creator God who was born of the virgin Mary, and that is whose birth we celebrate at Christmas.
There is no doubt, however, that Jesus is Creator God.

Jesus speaks of His Father over and over again.
One of the times He says,

> **"Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life."** [(Jn 5:19‑24 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/John+5/)

Jesus, the Son, is obedient to his Father, who is also God.
However, their mission for sinners is clear.
They created them, but now they will save them from the judgment of death.
The love of the Father and the Son extends to the sinner who has rebelled against them and has earned the judgment of death.
_[Point to Baptism window.]_ Behold the Son being baptized with sinners and for sinners.
Hear now His Word for sinners:

> **Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.**

There is a name for God to be used when baptizing sinners and bringing them into Christ's kingdom, and that name is *Father, Son, and Holy Spirit*.
That is the name of God given to us by Christ Himself.
If you like to speak in shorthand, call Him *Trinity*.
We are not told in the Bible to use this shorthand, but we use it with good conscience to point to the one God---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---who has saved us by the death of the Son and in whose name we are baptized.
	AMEN.
