## First reading [Is 6:1-8 ESV]

[1] In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.
[2] Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 
[3] And one called to another and said:

> “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;\
> the whole earth is full of his glory!”

[4] And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
[5] And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; 
for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”

[6] Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. 
[7] And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

[8] And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.” 


## Epistle [Ac. 2:14a, 22-36 ESV; sermon text]

[14a] But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: [22] “Men of Israel, hear these words: 
Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, 
as you yourselves know— [23] this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and
killed by the hands of lawless men. [24] God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to 
be held by it. [25] For David says concerning him,

> “‘I saw the Lord always before me,\
> for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;\
> [26] therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;\
> my flesh also will dwell in hope.\
> [27] For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,\
> or let your Holy One see corruption.\
> [28] You have made known to me the paths of life;\
> you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’

[29] “Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is 
with us to this day. [30] Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of 
his descendants on his throne, [31] he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, 
nor did his flesh see corruption. [32] This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. [33] Being therefore exalted 
at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you 
yourselves are seeing and hearing. [34] For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,

> “‘The Lord said to my Lord,\
> “Sit at my right hand,\
> [35] until I make your enemies your footstool.”’

[36] Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you 
crucified.”

## Holy Gospel [Jn 3:1-17 ESV]

[1]Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. [2] This man came to Jesus by night and said to 
him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.” 
[3] Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” [4] Nicodemus 
said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” [5] Jesus 
answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. [6] That 
which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. [7] Do not marvel that I said to you, 
‘You must be born again.’ [8] The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from 
or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

[9] Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” [10] Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not 
understand these things? [11] Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, 
but you[f] do not receive our testimony. [12] If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if 
I tell you heavenly things? [13] No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. [14] And 
as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, [15] that whoever believes in him may 
have eternal life.

[16] “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal 
life. [17] For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through 
him. 

## Introit [Ps 16:8-11; antiphon: Liturgical Text]

> Blessed be the Holy Trinity and the undivided | Unity.\*\
> Let us give glory to him because he has shown his mer- | cy to us.\
> I have set the Lord always be- | fore me;\*\
> because he is at my right hand, I shall not be | shaken.\
> Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being re- | joices;\*\
> my flesh also | dwells secure.\
> For you will not abandon my soul | to Sheol,\*\
> or let your holy one see cor- | ruption.\
> You make known to me the | path of life;\*\
> in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures for- | evermore.\

## Sermon

Beloved in the Lord, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
You know where the trouble began in the Garden of Eden.
There were two trees in the midst of the garden: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
It was from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that Satan deceived Eve to eat.
She ate and she gave of the fruit to her husband Adam, and he ate it, too.
And what do you know?
They ate the forbidden fruit---the fruit that God told them not to eat or they would die--and they did gain the knowledge of good and evil.
They knew something they did not know before: they knew they were naked and hid themselves from God.
They knew they were naked and immediately sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves up.

Not to sound silly, but do *we* know it when we are naked?
Do we try to cover ourselves like Adam and Eve?
Do we think it a good idea to put on clothes when other people are around? 
Then let that be our daily reminder of our fallen life---the same change that Adam and Eve experienced in the Garden of Eden when they fell into sin.
Whatever change came upon Adam and Eve when they at the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil---whatever change came upon them when they realized they were naked---that change has been passed to you and me as sure as we know when we are naked, as sure as we grow weak and die.
We are infected by sin from Adam, and we need a cure.

Then God cast Adam and Eve out of the Garden with these words:

> **“Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—” therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.** [(Gn 3:22‑24 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3:22/)

You noticed that God kept them away from the tree of life with cherubim and a flaming sword.
And God Himself said that Adam and Eve had come to know good and evil, but did you catch *how* he said it? **"Behold, the man has become like one of _us_."**
Sounds like a committee: **"one of _us_."**
Yet in Deuteronomy, chapter 6, verse 4, Moses clearly declares, **"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is _one_"** [(Dt 6:4 ESV)].
So which is the one true God: Is He one God or is He a committee?

Beloved in the Lord, today is Trinity Sunday, and I want you to know that the word *Trinity* does not even appear in the Bible.
The word *Trinity* does not appear in the Bible, *[Point to Baptism window.]* but Jesus *was* baptized:

> **And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”** [(Mt 3:16‑17 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+3:16/)

*The Father's* voice is heard from heaven, *the Son* is baptized by John the Baptist, and *the Holy Spirit* descends like a dove and comes to rest on the Son.
In the Church, we describe this as *three Persons*.
*And* we have Christ's command: **"Go make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"** (Mt 28:19).
We have Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---three Persons---as God's name in whom we baptize according to Christ's command.
And we also have Father, Son, and Holy Spirit at Christ's own Baptism.
*Trinity* is shorthand for these three Persons---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
Though they are three persons, they are *one God*, as Moses declared.
Beloved in the Lord, this is a mystery that we give the name *Trinity*.
*We worship one God in trinity and Trinity in unity,
neither confusing the persons nor dividing the substance.*
In short, the Bible reveals to us that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are *one* true God---a mystery, but it is true.

Now keep this in mind as we return to our Old Testament reading,
where the prophet Isaiah sees God:

> **In the year that King Uzziah died _I saw the Lord_ sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:**

> **“_Holy, holy, holy_ is the Lord of hosts;**\
> **the whole earth is full of his glory!”**

> **And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.** [(Is 6:1‑4 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+6:1/)

Christians have from early on interpreted the seraphim praising God and calling out, **"Holy, holy, holy"** three times as praising the Trinity.
Repeating **"Holy, holy, holy"** three times tells us who the Lord is that Isaiah saw: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
Ambrose was pastor at Milan, Italy in the 300's between 350 and 400 A.D.
We would call that *early church*.
(Ambrose, by the way, wrote the Christmas hymn *Savior of the Nations, Come*.)
Ambrose is a Christian pastor who, from early on, taught the Trinty, and here is how he interpreted the **"Holy, holy, holy"**:

> "[The seraphim] say it, not once, lest you should believe that there is but one; not twice, lest you should exclude the Spirit; they say not *holies*, lest you should imagine that there is plurality, but they repeat three times and say the same word, that even in a hymn you may understand the distinction of Persons in the Trinity, and the oneness of the Godhead."[^1]

[^1]: *Luteran Study Bible*, footnote for Is 6:3.

That is Ambrose's way of teaching what we confessed today in the Athanasian Creed.

Isaiah is in the presence of God and he is afraid:

> **“Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”**

A sinner in the presence of God is afraid to die.
Isaiah is infected with the same sin you and I are.
He is infected by sin from Adam, and he needs a cure.

> **Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”**

We know that Christ's blood shed on the Cross atones for our sin,
but what touches our lips every Communion Sunday? **"Take, eat. This is My body given for you. ... This cup is the new testament in My blood, shed for the forgiveness of your sins."**

**"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"** [(Php 4:7 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4:7/).
AMEN.
