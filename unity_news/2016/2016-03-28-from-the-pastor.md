## From the Pastor

Dear Unity family, I am writing these words the day after Easter on the train to visit my parents. Memory after beautiful memory enters my mind, and I thank you who made these memories possible! I thank the workers behind the scenes that made our church ready to receive our members and our visitors: preparing weeks ahead of time and getting up early on Easter Sunday.

The sanctuary reflected the glory of our resurrected Lord and smelled of Easter lilies. The music! Not only the anthems of the Resurrection, but the music for all of Holy Week was beautiful, from professional musicianship to the youth belting out *Alleluia*.

The sanctuary may have smelled of Easter lilies, but the cafeteria smelled of egg strata, pancakes, and coffee. Mmm! And the voices of friends to go along with it? Can't beat it! And on that note: Thank you everyone who came!

The sunrise service at the Lutheran Cemetery was blessed with good attendance and a clear sunrise for the proclamation of Christ's Resurrection. Had Jesus not risen from the dead, what would bring us together? What *could* bring us together? And, of course, had Jesus not risen from the dead, or faith would be in vain and we would still be dead in our sins (1CoÂ 15:17). Thank you, Jesus, that we need not worry about these things! Alleluia! Amen!
