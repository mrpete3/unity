## From the Pastor

Cleveland has finally won a championship!
I was not born in Cleveland; I was not raised in Cleveland; but Cleveland is home.
I have never seen a sports victory mean so much to so many people since the USA won hockey gold in the 1980 Winter Olympics.
“Where were you when the Cavs won the championship?” will be asked for years to come.
I pray that the goodwill created by the Cavs' championship will bring a drop in crime to our city.
(And after the Indians win the World Series, Cleveland will be paradise on earth.)

Which is greater: the Cavs winning the championship or the Baptism of a child?
Which is greater: All the money of PNC and Key Bank put together or God allowing rain to fall from the sky?

Were rain never to fall from the sky, there would be no harvest, no Save‑A‑Lot, no food at all.
We would all die, of course, but before that, all the economies of the world would collapse, and the money held by banks would be worthless.
When we pray, “Give us this day our daily bread,” we are also praying for rain, without which there is no daily bread, without which there is no human endeavor, no money, no goods and services to buy and sell.
God allowing a drop of rain from the sky is far greater than all the money of all the banks in the world.

Is there any alternative to rain for giving us our daily bread? No. God has ordered our earthly existence to depend on rain and He gives it to us.
Do not be offended because rain constrains us‒God is good and gives rain even without our prayers, even to evil people.

But it seems like missing the Baptism of a child would not be significant compared to The Cavs winning the championship and lifting our city out of the Curse.
Alexander the Great not only conquered, but established order and a common culture (Greek) which can be thought of as having brought civilization to greater and perhaps nobler heights.
