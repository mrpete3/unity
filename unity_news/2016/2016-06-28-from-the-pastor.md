## From the Pastor

Cleveland has finally won a championship!
I was not born in Cleveland; I was not raised in Cleveland; but Cleveland is home.
I have never seen a sports victory mean so much to so many people since the USA won hockey gold in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.
“Where were you when the Cavs won the championship?” will be asked for years to come.
I pray that the goodwill created by the championship will bring a drop in crime to our city.

Which is greater: the Cavs winning the championship or ?
Which is greater: the conquests of Alexander the Great (undefeated in battle after having conquered the territory from Greece to India) or David slaying Goliath (1 Samuel 17)?
