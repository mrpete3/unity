## From the Pastor

I want to share with you a story told to me by George Curran.

In the 1920's in Pennsylvania, two boys were born, went to the same school, and graduated from high school.
One became an auctioneer and the other one an artist.
The artist married and had a son.
Around 1940, the son joined the Army and was killed overseas.
The father kept on painting until he died and he left a will for his best friend, the auctioneer, the executor of his will.

A few years later, the auctioneer organized an auction to auction off all the paintings, including a painting of the artist's son.
He rented a building for the auction.
Everyone who came in was given a paddle with a number for bidding.
The auctioneer decided to start the auction,
and the first work of art put on auction was the picture of the artist's son.

“Can I get $20 for this picture of the artist's son?”

Nobody replied.

“Can I have a $10 bid?”

Nobody replied.

“I ask for a $5 bid.”

Nobody replied.

“Let's take a break for right now and see if any more people come to the auction.”

A few more people did come.
The auctioneer again attempted to auction of the picture of the son.
He started at a lower price.

“Can I get $10 for this picture of the artist's son?”

No one replied.

“Can I get $5 for this picture of the artist's son?”

No one replied.

“We'll take another 15‑minute break and see if more people come.”

The auctioneer came back and said, “Let's start it all over again.”
He held up the picture of the artist's son and said,
“Can I get a bid of $10 for this artist's picture?”

Nobody replied.

“Can I get a bid of $5 for a picture of the artist's son?”

One man in the front row raised his paddle and bid $5.
The auctioneer looked at him and asked,
“You've been here right from the beginning.
Why are you bidding now?”

“I would have been out-bidded.
I'd like to have a picture of the artist's son as a souveneir.”

The auctioneer said, “We're going to take a 10‑minute break.”
He went back to his office and came back ten minutes later with the will.
He read some of the will and said,
“This auction is over with.
Whoever purchases the picture of the artist's son will inherit the whole collection.”

In the same way, when we have the Son of God, we inherit the whole collection.

> **He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?** (Romans 8:32 ESV)
