## From the Pastor

I want to share with you a story told to me by George Curran.

Two boys were born in the 1890's in Pennsylvania and grew up in the same town.
They went to grade school together; they went to high school together.
One became an auctioneer and the other an artist.
The artist married and had a son.
This son, his only child, joined the Army and was killed overseas during World War II.
His father kept painting until he died and gained some fame as an artist.
He named his auctioneer friend as executor of his estate.

According to the artist's will, his friend organized an auction for his paintings.
A gallery was rented and the auction began.
The first work of art put on auction was a portrait of the artist's son, which was not considered to be among his most valuable paintings.

“Can I get $20 for this picture of the artist's son?”

Nobody bid.

“Can I have a $10 bid?”

Nothing.

“I ask for a $5 bid.”

No one raised a paddle.

“Let's take a break for right now and see if any more people come to the auction.”

A few more people did come.
The auctioneer again showed the portrait of the son.

“Can I get $10 for this picture of the artist's son?”

No one replied.

“Can I get $5?”

No one.

“We'll take another 15‑minute break and see if more people come.”

The auction was adjourned for a second time while one more bidder joined the auction.
When the auctioneer returned, he said, “Let's start all over again.”
He held up the picture of the artist's son and said,
“Can I get a bid of $10 for this picture?”

No one replied.

“Can I get a bid of $5?”

Finally, a man in the front row, who had been at the auction all along, raised his paddle.
The auctioneer looked at him and asked,
“You've been here right from the beginning.
Why are you bidding now?”

The man answered, “Let's get the bidding started on the rest of the art. I'll take the portrait of the son as a souvenir.”

The auctioneer said, “Just a minute.”
He returned with the artist's will in his hand and held it over his head and said,
“According to the will, this auction is over!
The man who bought the portrait of the artist's son gets the whole collection.”

Though many do not care for Him, when we have the Son of God, we have our heavenly Father's whole collection.

> **He that spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?** (Romans 8:32 KJV)
