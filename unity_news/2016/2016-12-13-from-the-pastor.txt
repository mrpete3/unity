% From the Pastor

Recently, during my work as Ohio District Archivist, I received an offer to archive many copies of the *Lutheran Boys and Girls* and *Lutheran Young People* magazines.
These fine Christian magazines were published in the 1930's.
They were offered to the Ohio District by Mrs. Cherie Lane; the magazines had belonged to her sainted mother, Adelaide (Kaltenbach) Hasko.

> My mother had unwavering faith in Jesus Christ.  She saved these publications all of her life,
along with many other treasures of her childhood.   The greatest gift she passed on to me ... and my children, was her faith.
In memory of her deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ, which
in part she learned through these publications, I would like to donate them to the Ohio LCMS.

Little did I know then that Mrs. Hasko had been baptized at one month old at Unity by Pastor Long on July 13, 1919.
And so, from a faith started here 97 years ago by the Baptism of Adelaide Kaltenbach, which from infancy grew into adulthood and passed on to her daughter, I offer to you her daughter's testimony of faith.
