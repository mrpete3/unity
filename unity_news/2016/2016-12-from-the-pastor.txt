% From the Pastor

At this very moment as I write, I am anticipating snowfall and shoveling.
Help us, dear Lord Jesus, that none of us slip, fall, and suffer injury this winter!
Of course, anyone can be just as well injured by exposure to cold.
And I am concerned for the majority of young folks who do not wear hat, scarves, or mittens in the cold.
Even if they were given hats, scarves, and mittens, many would not wear them.
