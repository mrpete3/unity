Dear Unity family, celebrating the 500th anniversary of the Reformation is a big deal, and I hope many of you will join me in the Reformation March to come in August. We will march from Trinity on West 30th Street to Zion on East 30th, proclaiming Christ to be the light of the world (John 12:46), as the prophet Isaiah foretold:

> **The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;**\
> **those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.** (Isaiah 9:2 ESV)

This deep darkness is not a physical darkness, but a spiritual darkness---the dreadful tyranny of the devil,
who lied in the Garden of Eden that God cannot be trusted.
Satan's powerful lie overcame Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) and spread to all men because all sinned (Romans 5:12).
The tyranny of the devil is to believe that God cannot be trusted.
The tyranny of the devil is to doubt what God has plainly said.
The tyranny of the devil is to make an idol to trust in place of the one true God.
The tyranny of the devil is to depend on your worthless idol when you are in trouble (Jeremiah 2:28).
The tyranny of the devil is to become worthless like the idol you worship (Jeremiah 2:5; Romans 3:12).
And finally, the tyranny of the devil is to die (John 8:44; Romans 6:23).
The tyranny of the devil is dreadful.

Ponder your own sin and that death will claim you (1 Corinthians 15:56), and you will respond in some way to your dread of death.
You may spend money on medical care.
You may make an effort to look younger.
You may even accumulate money or buy things just to make you feel alive.
The fear of death, the postponement of death, the avoidance of death---call it what you may---it may be your highest priority.

It makes perfect sense that there is something you can do---something, anything to keep death away.
God tells you to keep His Commandments: You shall have no other gods. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God. Love your neighbor as yourself.
Have you kept them so that you will not die? Or have you rebelled against them under the devil's tyranny?
It does make perfect sense to try to do something good to please God to merit life instead of death,
but the terrible news is that you have failed.

> **"None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one." ... For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.** (Romans 3:10‑12, 20 ESV)

These *works of the Law* mentioned by the apostle Paul are, in fact, God's Commandments.
Though the Commandments are good, all have failed, including you; you remain under the devil's dreadful tyranny; prepare to die.

Recall, however, that Jesus raised dead people back to life (Mark 5:35‑42; Luke 7:14‑15; John 11:43‑44).
Remember also that soon after Pentecost, the apostle Peter healed a lame beggar.

> **Peter said [to the beggar], “I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!” And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. And leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.** [(Acts 3:6‑9 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+3/)

This healing happened at the temple in Jerusalem, where many people were watching.
Peter turned to the people and said,

> **The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, and you killed *the Author of life*, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And his name---by faith in his name---has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.** [(Ac 3:13‑16 ESV)](https://www.esv.org/Acts+3/)

Jesus is phenomenal! Not only can He raise the dead, but a no good failure like Peter can heal the lame in His name.
Consider what a good job your Lord Jesus has done for you.
Suppose a new worker comes to your job who is so good that he is able to do your job and double sales *and* clean the toilets so that you have nothing to do---just sit around and get paid.
How long do you suppose would keep your job?

Beloved in the Lord, Jesus has put death and the grave out of a job. For those who believe in Him for the forgiveness of their sins, death and the grave are defeated and life itself is granted.
**Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.**
AMEN.

You may have noticed that many references to Bible verses in the parentheses.
This is because what we are to know about our salvation is revealed not by man's opinion but by *Scripture alone* (2 Timothy 3:15).

We are Christians and we are the light of the world (Mt 5:14).
