Dear Unity family, I will continue in this article where I left off last time.
The Bible draws parallels between the Babylonian captivity of the Old Testament and the end times in which we live today.
In other words, do not read just the book of Revelation to interpret the end times: read also the Old Testament prophets, especially the ones who wrote around the time of the Babylonian captivity, and *read first* what our Lord Himself says about the end times ([Matthew 24](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+24/); [Mark 13](https://www.esv.org/Mark+13/); [Luke 21:10‑36](https://www.esv.org/Luke+21:10/)).
The biblical clue I shared in my last article is that the prophet Ezekiel began to prophesy just prior to the Babylonian captivity, and his initial vision is nearly identical to the intial vision of the apostle John in Revelation ([Ezekiel 1:10](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+1:10/); [Revelation 4:6‑8](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+4:6/)).
How could you then read Revelation and ignore Ezekiel? Better not ignore Jeremiah, Daniel, or Zechariah, either.

Both the Babylonian captivity and the end times are terrible times of despair and suffering ([Jeremiah 19:3](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+19:3/); [Mark 13:19](https://www.esv.org/Mark+13:19/))---the Babylonian captivity in the past and the end times in the present.
President Trump just shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and there is hope of peace on the Korean peninsula for the first time in my lifetime. God be praised!
However, beloved in the Lord, heed God's Word:

> **Concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need to have anything written to you. For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.** ([1 Thessalonians 5:1‑3](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+5/) ESV)

The despair and suffering of the Babylonian captivity (605‑538 B.C.) was God's judgment of idolatry in Old Testament Israel ([Jeremiah 1:16](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+1:16/)); the low point being the siege and destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Bablyon (587 B.C.; [Ezekiel 24](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+24/); [Jeremiah 39](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+39/)).
The siege leading up to the destruction of the city and its temple was horrible: the hunger intensified to the point of cannibalism ([Jeremiah 19:9](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+19:9/))!
There is no avoiding God's wrath for idolatry.
God forces idolaters to drink from the cup full of the wine of His wrath ([Jeremiah 25:15‑38](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+25:15/)).

Turn now to the Garden of Gethsemane window in our sanctuary.
There you see the cup of God's wrath coming from the Father for His Son to drink for us as he prays, **"Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done"** ([Luke 22:42](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22:42/) ESV).
Though there is no avoiding God's wrath for idolatry, God nevertheless shows mercy to sinners; He shows us mercy by having His only-begotten Son Jesus drink the cup of His wrath *in our place*: this is the greatest teaching of the Bible!
The core of our sin is idolatry, for we have not feared, loved, and trusted in God above all things.
We have turned to worthless gods of our own making and have broken the rest of the Ten Commandments along the way ([Romans 3:10‑12](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3:10/)).

Turn now to the Crucifixion window in our sanctuary and you will see why it is next to the Garden of Gethsemane window.
There, dying on the Cross in the stead of sinners, Jesus drinks the cup of His Father's wrath against our idolatry.

> **Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,**\
> **O God of my salvation,**\
> **and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.** ([Psalm 51:14](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+51:14/) ESV)

The point is that the Babylonian captivity points directly to the Cross; it does not skip over the Cross and jump to the Book of Revelation.
The Babylonian captivity informs us about the end times, but it points to the Cross.

The despair and suffering of the end times is God's judgment of apostasy.
*Idolatry* and *apostasy* are two sides of the same coin.
The idolatry of the Old Testament Israelites was that they worshiped foreign gods even though God had revealed Himself to them as their Redeemer who brought them out of Egyptian slavery with a mighty arm and gave them His Law to live by ([Jeremiah 31:32](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31:32/)).
God saved both idolatrous Jew and idolatrous Gentile by the new covenant of the Cross (of which we partake in Holy Communion ([Matthew 26:27‑28](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+26:27/); [Luke 22:20](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22:20/); [1 Corinthians 11:25](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+11:25/))!) where our sins are remembered no more ([Jeremiah 31:34](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31:34/)).
The apostasy of the end times is to turn away from the new convenant---turn away from Jesus, turn away from the Cross, turn away from Baptism, turn away from Holy Communion---drive the Holy Spirit out---and let the demons back in ([Luke 11:24‑26](https://www.esv.org/Luke+11:24/)).
We are entering terrible times.
Apostasy is like idolatry in that, God forbid, we do not fear, love, and trust God---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---who saved us from sin and slavery to Satan ([John 8:34](https://www.esv.org/John+8:34/)).

What is in store for us? Trouble, and especially for believers.

> **Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.** ([Matthew 10:21‑22](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+10:21/) ESV)

> **Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.** ([Revelation 2:10](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+2:10/) ESV)

Specifically, we have to deal with the antichrist, who has left Christ's Church and denies the Father and the Son ([1 John 2:18‑23](https://www.esv.org/1+John+2:18/); [2 John 7‑8](https://www.esv.org/2+John+7/)).
Though the antichrist makes war against Christ, take note: even the antichrist points to the Cross.
If Jesus were nothing, the antichrist would have no need to speak against Him.

> **By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.** ([1 John 4:2‑4](https://www.esv.org/1+John+4:2/) ESV)

Beloved in the Lord, Jesus in your heart is greater than the devil in the world.
Cling to Jesus: His blood shed for you and given upon your lips at the altar, His Baptism, His forgiveness.
You will receive the crown of life.
