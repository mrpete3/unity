Dear Unity family, I will continue in this article where I left off.
The Bible draws parallels between the Babylonian captivity of the Old Testament and the end times in which we live today.
Both the Babylonian captivity and the end times are terrible times of despair and suffering ([Jeremiah 19:3](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+19:3/); [Mark 13:19](https://www.esv.org/Mark+13:19/))---the Babylonian captivity in the past and the end times present.
President Trump just shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and there is hope of peace on the Korean peninsula for the first time in my lifetime. God be praised!
However, beloved in the Lord, heed God's Word:

> **Concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need to have anything written to you. For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.** ([1 Thessalonians 5:1‑3](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+5/) ESV)

The despair and suffering of the Babylonian captivity (605‑538 B.C.) was God's judgment of idolatry in Old Testament Israel ([Jeremiah 1:16](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+1:16/)); the low point being the siege and destruction of the Jerusalem temple by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Bablyon (587 B.C.; [Ezekiel 24](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+24/); [Jeremiah 39](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+39/)).
The siege leading up to the destruction of the city and its temple was horrible: the hunger intensified to the point of cannibalism ([Jeremiah 19:9](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+19:9/)).
In the prophecy of Jeremiah, God foretells this captivity and descruction of the temple, using the illustration of drinking from the cup of God's wrath ([Jeremiah 25:15‑38](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+25:15/)).
When the prophet Ezekiel began to prophesy just prior to the destruction of Jerusalem, his initial vision was nearly identical to the intial vision of the apostle John in Revelation ([Ezekiel 1:10](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+1:10/); [Revelation 4:6‑8](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+4:6/)).

The despair and suffering of the end times is God's judgment of apostasy.
*Idolatry* and *apostasy* are two sides of the same coin.
The idolatry of the Old Testament Israelites was that God had revealed Himself to them as their Redeemer from Egyptian slavery who brought them out with a mighty arm and faithfully went with them through the wilderness to the Promised Land, but still they still and worshiped worthless foreign gods ([Psalm 97:7](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+97:7/)).
The apostasy of the end times is that God has revealed Himself to us as our Redeemer from slavery to sin and Satan ([John 8:44](https://www.esv.org/John+8:44/))
